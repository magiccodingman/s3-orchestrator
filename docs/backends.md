Configuration, routing strategies, multi-backend topologies, and the provider quick-reference table.

## Backend configuration


Each backend is an S3-compatible storage service with its own credentials and optional quota.

```yaml
backends:
  - name: "oci"
    endpoint: "https://namespace.compat.objectstorage.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com"
    region: "us-phoenix-1"
    bucket: "my-oci-bucket"
    access_key_id: "${OCI_ACCESS_KEY}"
    secret_access_key: "${OCI_SECRET_KEY}"
    force_path_style: true
    quota_bytes: 21474836480     # 20 GB
```

**Endpoint URLs by provider:**

| Provider | Endpoint format | `force_path_style` |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| OCI Object Storage | `https://<namespace>.compat.objectstorage.<region>.oraclecloud.com` | `true` |
| Backblaze B2 | `https://s3.<region>.backblazeb2.com` | `true` |
| AWS S3 | `https://s3.<region>.amazonaws.com` | `false` |
| MinIO | `http://<host>:9000` | `true` |
| Wasabi | `https://s3.<region>.wasabisys.com` | `true` |

**Quota:** Set `quota_bytes` to limit how much data a backend can hold. Set to `0` or omit for unlimited. Quota is tracked in PostgreSQL and updated atomically with every write/delete. Note that multipart uploads do not reserve quota upfront - temporary parts consume backend storage without being counted against the quota until `CompleteMultipartUpload` records the final object size. A client uploading many large parts could temporarily exceed a backend's quota before completion.

**Max object size:** Some providers impose per-object size limits (e.g. Supabase rejects uploads over 50 MB with 413 EntityTooLarge). Set `max_object_size` to prevent the orchestrator from routing writes, rebalance moves, or replication copies to a backend when the object exceeds the limit:

```yaml
    max_object_size: 52428800    # 50 MB (0 = unlimited)
```

**Usage limits:** Optional monthly caps on API requests, egress, and ingress per backend:

```yaml
    api_request_limit: 20000     # monthly API calls (0 = unlimited)
    egress_byte_limit: 1073741824  # 1 GB monthly egress (0 = unlimited)
    ingress_byte_limit: 0        # unlimited ingress
```

When a backend exceeds a usage limit, writes overflow to the next eligible backend. Limits reset each month automatically.

**Request pools:** `api_request_limit` charges every operation against one allowance, which is not how providers bill. GCS meters uploads and listings from a small Class A allowance, reads from a much larger Class B one, and does not bill deletes at all; B2 splits them differently again. Collapsing that into one number means setting it to the strictest class and wasting the rest, or to the loosest and blowing the strict one.

`request_limits` names the grouping instead, and `unmetered` lists the operations the provider gives away:

```yaml
    unmetered: [DeleteObject, DeleteObjects, AbortMultipartUpload]
    request_limits:
      - name: class_a
        operations: [PutObject, CopyObject, CreateMultipartUpload, UploadPart, CompleteMultipartUpload, ListObjects, ListObjectsV2]
        limit: 5000
      - name: class_b
        operations: [GetObject, HeadObject, GetParts]
        limit: 50000
```

Pools are additive: an operation charges every pool that contains it and is admitted only when all of them have headroom, so a per-operation sub-cap can sit inside an aggregate one. `operations: ["*"]` covers every operation not listed as `unmetered`, and `limit: 0` means the pool is counted but never refuses.

Unmetered operations are still recorded against the backend's request total -- not billing an operation is not a reason to stop reporting it -- they are simply charged to no budget. Deletes are never refused on any budget regardless, since refusing one would leave an operator unable to get back under a limit.

`api_request_limit` remains valid and desugars to a single pool named `all` over `["*"]`, so existing configs are unchanged. Setting both it and `request_limits` on one backend is rejected.

Valid operation names: `PutObject`, `GetObject`, `HeadObject`, `DeleteObject`, `DeleteObjects`, `CopyObject`, `ListObjects`, `ListObjectsV2`, `CreateMultipartUpload`, `UploadPart`, `CompleteMultipartUpload`, `AbortMultipartUpload`, `GetParts`.

Per-pool usage is published as `s3o_usage_pool_requests{backend,pool}` against `s3o_usage_pool_limit{backend,pool}`. Watch those rather than `s3o_usage_api_requests` when a backend stops accepting work: the total counts every call, including ones no budget charges.

**Unsigned payload:** By default, uploads stream directly to backends without buffering the entire body in memory. The AWS SDK normally buffers the request body to compute a SigV4 payload hash (SHA-256), but the orchestrator uses `UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD` to skip this. Without streaming, large uploads (multipart completion, replication) can cause out-of-memory kills.

For HTTPS endpoints, unsigned payload is enabled by default. For plain HTTP endpoints, it is auto-disabled unless explicitly set - AWS S3 rejects unsigned payloads over HTTP, but most S3-compatible backends (MinIO, R2, etc.) accept them. Set `unsigned_payload: true` on HTTP backends to enable streaming:

```yaml
    unsigned_payload: true   # stream uploads without buffering (auto-enabled for HTTPS)
```

Set `unsigned_payload: false` to force payload hashing. This buffers the entire object in memory before uploading - only use this if you have a specific compliance requirement for end-to-end payload integrity independent of TLS.

Streaming never means an unknown length: every upload declares its size up front, so `Content-Length` is always sent and `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` is never used. That matters because SigV4 signs `content-length`, so a request that streams without it cannot validate - backends that require the header answer `411`, and backends that merely check the signature answer `403 SignatureDoesNotMatch`.

**Disable checksum:** AWS SDK v2 defaults to sending streaming checksums (CRC64NVME) on uploads. Some S3-compatible providers - notably Google Cloud Storage - reject these with `SignatureDoesNotMatch`. Set `disable_checksum: true` on backends that don't support the AWS checksum headers:

```yaml
    disable_checksum: true   # required for GCS HMAC interoperability
```

This sets the SDK's `RequestChecksumCalculation` and `ResponseChecksumValidation` to `WhenRequired`, disabling automatic checksum injection without affecting SigV4 request signing.

**Strip SDK headers:** AWS SDK v2 adds headers (`amz-sdk-invocation-id`, `amz-sdk-request`, `accept-encoding`) and a query parameter (`x-id`) that are included in the SigV4 signed header set. Google Cloud Storage does not include these when verifying the signature, causing `SignatureDoesNotMatch` errors. Set `strip_sdk_headers: true` to remove them before request signing:

```yaml
    strip_sdk_headers: true   # required for GCS HMAC interoperability
```

For GCS backends, you typically need both `disable_checksum: true` and `strip_sdk_headers: true`:

```yaml
  - name: "gcs"
    endpoint: "https://storage.googleapis.com"
    region: "auto"
    bucket: "my-bucket"
    access_key_id: "GOOG..."
    secret_access_key: "..."
    force_path_style: true
    disable_checksum: true
    strip_sdk_headers: true
```

**Credential source:** `credential_source` selects how the orchestrator obtains credentials for the backend. Default is `static`, which uses the `access_key_id` / `secret_access_key` fields above. Set to `default_chain` to delegate to the AWS SDK's default credential chain (env vars, EC2 IMDS, SSO, `~/.aws/credentials`, STS assume-role). When `default_chain` is set, the two key fields must be omitted - leaving stale keys behind is rejected at validation so they cannot silently shadow the SDK-resolved credentials.

Use `default_chain` when:

- The orchestrator runs on an EC2 instance with an IAM role attached (IMDS-vended credentials rotate every ~6 hours and cannot be tracked by YAML).
- Local development uses SSO (`aws sso login`) instead of long-lived keys.
- You want the SDK to resolve credentials via STS assume-role chains.

```yaml
  - name: "aws-prod"
    endpoint: "https://s3.amazonaws.com"
    region: "us-east-1"
    bucket: "my-prod-bucket"
    credential_source: "default_chain"
    # access_key_id / secret_access_key intentionally omitted
```

Note: the config loader already expands `${ENV_VAR}` references at load time, so `access_key_id: ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}` covers the env-var case under `credential_source: static`. Use `default_chain` for credential sources the loader cannot reach (IMDS, SSO, STS) and for cases where refresh matters.


## Routing strategy


Controls how the orchestrator selects a backend when writing new objects.

```yaml
routing_strategy: "pack"       # "pack" or "spread" (default: pack)
```

- **pack** (default) - tries backends in config order, filling the first until it is full and overflowing to the next. Best for stacking free-tier allocations sequentially.
- **spread** - tries backends least-utilized first, by the ratio `(bytes_used + orphan_bytes + in-flight) / bytes_limit`. Best for distributing storage evenly across backends.

The strategy decides the order candidates are tried, not which one accepts. A backend admits a write by letting its pending intent insert succeed, and that insert tests the backend's live headroom - stored bytes, orphans awaiting cleanup, and writes already in flight - against its ceiling. A backend with no room declines and the next candidate is tried; a write no candidate accepts fails with 507.

Usage limits are separate and are applied when building the candidate list, so a backend over its monthly API or bandwidth allowance is never ranked in the first place.


## Multi-backend configurations


### Single backend with quota

The simplest setup. One backend with a byte cap:

```yaml
backends:
  - name: "oci"
    endpoint: "https://namespace.compat.objectstorage.region.oraclecloud.com"
    region: "us-phoenix-1"
    bucket: "my-bucket"
    access_key_id: "${OCI_KEY}"
    secret_access_key: "${OCI_SECRET}"
    force_path_style: true
    quota_bytes: 21474836480     # 20 GB
```

### Multiple backends with quotas (pack routing)

Stack multiple free-tier allocations. With the default `routing_strategy: "pack"`, when one backend fills up, writes overflow to the next. Use `routing_strategy: "spread"` instead to distribute objects evenly by utilization ratio:

```yaml
backends:
  - name: "oci-free"
    endpoint: "https://namespace.compat.objectstorage.region.oraclecloud.com"
    region: "us-phoenix-1"
    bucket: "free-tier-bucket"
    access_key_id: "${OCI_KEY}"
    secret_access_key: "${OCI_SECRET}"
    force_path_style: true
    quota_bytes: 21474836480     # 20 GB (OCI free tier)

  - name: "b2-free"
    endpoint: "https://s3.us-west-002.backblazeb2.com"
    region: "us-west-002"
    bucket: "free-tier-bucket"
    access_key_id: "${B2_KEY}"
    secret_access_key: "${B2_SECRET}"
    force_path_style: true
    quota_bytes: 10737418240     # 10 GB (B2 free tier)
```

This gives you 30 GB of combined storage across two providers.

### Multiple backends without quotas (requires replication or spread)

When all backends are unlimited and using the default `pack` routing, only the first backend would receive writes. To distribute data, either set `replication.factor >= 2` to replicate across backends, or use `routing_strategy: "spread"` to distribute writes by utilization ratio.

```yaml
backends:
  - name: "oci"
    endpoint: "https://namespace.compat.objectstorage.region.oraclecloud.com"
    region: "us-phoenix-1"
    bucket: "bucket-a"
    access_key_id: "${OCI_KEY}"
    secret_access_key: "${OCI_SECRET}"
    force_path_style: true
    # no quota_bytes - unlimited

  - name: "aws"
    endpoint: "https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"
    region: "us-east-1"
    bucket: "bucket-b"
    access_key_id: "${AWS_KEY}"
    secret_access_key: "${AWS_SECRET}"
    # no quota_bytes - unlimited

replication:
  factor: 2
```

**Validation rule:** You cannot mix unlimited and quota-limited backends. Either all backends have `quota_bytes` set (quota routing) or all are unlimited (replication or spread routing required).


## Usage limits

## Usage Limits

Per-backend monthly limits for API requests, egress bytes, and ingress bytes. Set any limit to `0` (or omit it) for unlimited. Limits reset naturally each month - the usage tracking table is keyed by `YYYY-MM` period.

**Enforcement behavior:**

- **Writes** (PutObject, CopyObject, CreateMultipartUpload, UploadPart) - backends over their limits are excluded from selection; writes overflow to the next eligible backend. If all backends are over-limit, the orchestrator returns `507 InsufficientStorage`.
- **Reads** (GetObject, HeadObject) - over-limit backends are skipped; the orchestrator tries replicas. Returns `429 SlowDown` only when *all* copies of the object are on over-limit backends.
- **Deletes** (DeleteObject, DeleteObjects, AbortMultipartUpload) - always allowed regardless of limits.

Effective usage is computed as `DB baseline + unflushed counters + proposed operation`, so enforcement stays accurate between flush/refresh cycles without double-counting. The flush interval is configurable (default 30s) and can adaptively shorten when backends approach their limits. For multi-instance deployments, optional [Redis shared counters](#usage-counters) eliminate the cross-instance blind spot between flushes.
