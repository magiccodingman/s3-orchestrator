description: "Run s3-orchestrator locally in under a minute with Go, Docker, and Make: start the proxy, point an S3 client at it, and write the first object."
---

Get the S3 Orchestrator running locally in under a minute. The only prerequisites are **Go**, **Docker**, and **Make**.

## Start the orchestrator

```bash
git clone https://github.com/afreidah/s3-orchestrator.git
cd s3-orchestrator
make run
```

This starts three MinIO instances via Docker Compose, then launches the orchestrator pointing at them. The included `config.yaml` uses embedded SQLite (no external database needed) and is pre-configured for this environment - no manual setup required.

## What `make run` does

1. **`make dev-deps`** - runs `docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d` to start:
   - MinIO 1 on `localhost:19000` (bucket: `backend1`)
   - MinIO 2 on `localhost:19002` (bucket: `backend2`)
   - MinIO 3 on `localhost:19004` (bucket: `backend3`)
   - A setup container that creates the MinIO buckets
   - PostgreSQL and Redis are also started for integration tests, but the default `config.yaml` uses embedded SQLite so neither is required for local development
2. **`go run ./cmd/s3-orchestrator -config config.yaml`** - compiles and starts the server on port 9000

## Test it

Upload and retrieve an object using the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws --endpoint-url http://localhost:9000 \
    s3 cp /etc/hostname s3://photos/test.txt \
    --region us-east-1

aws --endpoint-url http://localhost:9000 \
    s3 cp s3://photos/test.txt - \
    --region us-east-1
```

The config defines three virtual buckets (`photos`, `documents`, `backups`) with these credentials:

| Bucket | Access Key | Secret Key |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| `photos` | `photoskey` | `photossecret` |
| `documents` | `docskey` | `docssecret` |
| `backups` | `backupskey` | `backupssecret` |

Configure the AWS CLI profile to match:

```bash
aws configure --profile orchestrator
# AWS Access Key ID: photoskey
# AWS Secret Access Key: photossecret
# Default region name: us-east-1
# Default output format: json
```

Then use it:

```bash
alias s3o='aws --profile orchestrator --endpoint-url http://localhost:9000'
s3o s3 cp ./myfile.txt s3://photos/myfile.txt
s3o s3 ls s3://photos/
```

## Web dashboard

The dashboard is enabled at [http://localhost:9000/ui/](http://localhost:9000/ui/) with credentials `admin` / `admin`. It reports per-backend quota and request-budget usage, browses the object tree with each object's backend placement, and uploads files or whole folders into a bucket without a client.

## Metrics

Prometheus metrics are available at [http://localhost:9000/metrics](http://localhost:9000/metrics).

## Browse objects

Explore what you just stored with the terminal object browser:

```bash
go run ./cmd/s3-orchestrator tui
```

Navigate prefixes with the arrow keys and press `enter` on an object to open the inspector, which lists every backend copy. It reads the admin token from the local `config.yaml`. See [CLI subcommands](cli.md#tui).

## Validate the config

Check the configuration file without starting the server:

```bash
go run ./cmd/s3-orchestrator validate -config config.yaml
```

## Clean up

Stop the Docker containers and remove build artifacts:

```bash
make clean
```

`make clean` stops the containers but Docker volumes persist (MinIO data). SQLite data is stored locally in `dev-data.db`. To remove everything including stored data:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down -v
```

## Troubleshooting

- **`make run` fails immediately** - is Docker running? Check with `docker ps`.
- **Port 9000 already in use** - another service is on port 9000. Stop it or change `listen_addr` in `config.yaml`.
- **Container health checks failing** - check backing service logs: `docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml logs`
- **Stale data from a previous run** - clean volumes: `docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down -v`
