# Metadata Store Conventions

The metadata store is split into a composite interface plus a set of
narrow role interfaces. Consumers depend on the narrowest role they need;
the producer-side composite exists to wire one implementation through
DI and to back a single generated mock for tests. This page documents
the mechanical checks that keep that architecture consistent so adding
a store method does not require touching a long checklist.

---

## Layering

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `internal/store/core` | Role interfaces (`ObjectStore`, `QuotaStore`, `ReplicationStore`, ...). Shared error sentinels and value types live here. There is deliberately no composite of them: see below. |
| `internal/store/sqlite` | Concrete `*Store` for SQLite. Asserts the full role set at compile time via `core.AssertEngine`. |
| `internal/store/postgres` | Concrete `*Store` for PostgreSQL. Same compile-time assertions. |
| `internal/store/storetest` | Declares the test-only composite `storetest.MetadataStore` and hosts the mockgen-generated `MockMetadataStore`. |
| `internal/di` | Declares the unexported `metadataStore` composite, the only place production code holds an opened engine before splitting it into roles. |
| `internal/store/circuitbreaker.go` | `NewDatabaseBreaker` and the error filter; the breaker is installed at the SQL driver chokepoint so every store call passes through it. |

Worker / handler / proxy packages **never** import `internal/store/sqlite`
or `internal/store/postgres` directly. They take a narrow role interface
through DI and resolve to the concrete implementation only via
`internal/di/store.go`. The `depguard` rule
`store-boundary` in `.golangci.yml` enforces this mechanically: a
non-`internal/di`, non-`internal/cli`, non-test file that imports a
concrete store driver fails CI with a pointer back to this page.

## Adding a method to an existing role interface

1. Add the method to the role interface in `internal/store/core/interfaces.go`.
2. Implement it on both `internal/store/sqlite/*.go` and
   `internal/store/postgres/*.go`. The `core.AssertEngine` check in
   `sqlite/store.go` and `postgres/store.go` fails the build if either
   implementation is missing, naming the method that is absent.
3. From the repo root run `go generate ./internal/store/storetest/...`
   to regenerate the gomock mock. The composite `storetest.MetadataStore`
   is the single mock source of truth; tests that need imperative control
   wrap it via `testutil.NewMockStore`.
4. The driver-level circuit breaker installed by `NewDatabaseBreaker`
   wraps the `database/sql` DBTX surface, so the new method picks up
   `core.ErrDBUnavailable` semantics automatically. No per-method
   decorator to update.

---

## Adding a new role interface

1. Declare the interface in `internal/store/core/interfaces.go`. Keep it
   to the operations one consumer actually performs; resist the urge
   to bundle unrelated methods.
2. Embed the role in the `engineRoles` constraint in
   `internal/store/core/engine.go` so both engines must implement it, and
   in the unexported `metadataStore` composite in `internal/di/store.go`
   so the opened engine still satisfies what DI carries.
3. Embed the same interface in `internal/store/storetest/interface.go`
   so mockgen picks up the new methods.
4. Hand the role interface to consumers as a constructor argument. There
   is no wide type to pass by accident: the only composites are DI's
   unexported one and the test-only mock target.

---

## What is *not* needed

- **Per-method circuit-breaker decorators**: the breaker lives at the
  SQL driver chokepoint, so adding a method needs no decorator update.
  See `internal/store/circuitbreaker.go` and the `isDBError` filter for
  the application-vs-DB error classification.
- **Per-role compile-time assertions**: `core.AssertEngine[*Store]`
  covers every role in one line. Adding
  `var _ core.ObjectStore = (*Store)(nil)` would be redundant.
- **Hand-written mocks**: the gomock-generated `MockMetadataStore` is
  the only mock the test suite uses. New methods appear there
  automatically after `go generate`.

## Mechanical checks summary

| Check | Where | What it catches |
|---|---|---|
| `core.AssertEngine[*Store]` | `sqlite/store.go`, `postgres/store.go` | Either store implementation missing a method the role set requires. |
| Compile-time `var _ core.TxAdapter = ...` | `sqlite/adapter.go`, `postgres/adapter.go` | Tx-scoped role implementations missing methods. |
| `go generate ./internal/store/storetest/...` | `storetest/interface.go` | Out-of-date mock after an interface change. |
| Driver-level circuit breaker | `internal/store/circuitbreaker.go` | New store methods automatically get CB semantics. |
| `depguard` rule `store-boundary` | `.golangci.yml` | Non-DI / non-test code importing concrete store packages. |
| Unit + integration tests | `internal/store/{sqlite,postgres}` | Behavioural regressions and SQL drift. |
