The admin guide has been split into per-topic pages so each topic has a focused home rather than living in a single 2000-line reference. Start with the topic that matches what you're doing:

## Getting started

- **[Quickstart](quickstart.md)** - get a working deployment in under a minute
- **[Architecture](architecture.md)** - system diagram, storage layer, write routing

## Configuration

- **[Configuration walkthrough](configuration.md)** - every YAML block, validation rules, hot-reload matrix
- **[Authentication](authentication.md)** - SigV4 variants, credentials, multi-bucket isolation
- **[Backends](backends.md)** - provider quick-reference, routing strategies, usage limits, multi-backend topologies
- **[Database](database.md)** - engine choice (SQLite vs PostgreSQL), schema, goose migrations
- **[Encryption](encryption.md)** - envelope encryption, Vault Transit, key rotation, integrity verification
- **[Notifications](notifications.md)** - webhook outbox pattern, CloudEvents JSON, HMAC signing

## Operations

- **[Operations](operations.md)** - drain, rebalance, scrub, cache management, trace snapshot, credential rotation
- **[Replication](replication.md)** - replication factor, over-replication cleanup, orphan reconciliation
- **[Cleanup and lifecycle](cleanup-and-lifecycle.md)** - cleanup queue, PUT-before-COMMIT pending intents, lifecycle expiration
- **[CLI subcommands](cli.md)** - `version`, `init`, `validate`, `sync`, `admin`, `tui`
- **[Deployment](deployment.md)** - Nomad, Kubernetes, Docker, Debian package, multi-instance

## Observability and troubleshooting

- **[Monitoring](monitoring.md)** - full Prometheus metric reference, OpenTelemetry traces, structured logs, audit log, panic recovery, on-demand reconciliation
- **[Background services](background-services.md)** - worker reference table (intervals, advisory locks)
- **[Performance tuning](performance-tuning.md)** - connection pools, timeouts, broadcast tuning
- **[Disaster recovery](disaster-recovery.md)** - failure scenarios and recovery procedures
- **[Security hardening](security-hardening.md)** - TLS, mTLS, config security, network segmentation
- **[API reference](api-reference.md)** - UI and Admin API JSON endpoints
