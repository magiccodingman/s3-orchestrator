## database

The `driver` field selects between SQLite (embedded, zero-dependency) and PostgreSQL (required for multi-instance deployments). When `driver` is omitted, the orchestrator infers `postgres` if `host` is set, otherwise `sqlite`.

**SQLite (default for single-instance):**

```yaml
database:
  driver: sqlite
  path: "s3-orchestrator.db"     # default: s3-orchestrator.db
```

SQLite requires no external dependencies. The database file is created automatically on first start. Advisory lock-based leader election is replaced by a process-local mutex, so multi-instance deployments are not supported with SQLite.

**PostgreSQL (required for multi-instance):**

```yaml
database:
  driver: postgres
  host: "db.example.com"        # required
  port: 5432                     # default: 5432
  database: "s3orchestrator"     # required
  user: "s3orchestrator"         # required
  password: "${DB_PASSWORD}"
  ssl_mode: "require"            # default: require (use "disable" for local dev)
  max_conns: 50                  # default: 50; size to 2-3x max_concurrent_requests
  min_conns: 10                  # default: 5
  max_conn_lifetime: "5m"        # default: 5m
```

Pool settings (`max_conns`, `min_conns`, `max_conn_lifetime`) control the pgx connection pool. Size `max_conns` to 2-3x your `max_concurrent_requests` setting. See [Performance Tuning - Connection Pool Sizing](performance-tuning.md#connection-pool-sizing) for detailed guidance.


## Engines and schema

SQLite is the default for single-instance use; PostgreSQL is required for multi-instance deployments.

The orchestrator supports two metadata-store engines:

- **SQLite** (default) - embedded, zero-dependency, single-instance. Schema is
  applied at startup from a single consolidated `schema.sql` and pinned by a
  `schema_version` table, so a database written by a newer binary is refused
  rather than silently mis-read.
- **PostgreSQL** - required for multi-instance deployments. Connects via
  pgx/v5 pools and auto-applies versioned migrations on startup using
  [goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose); migration files are embedded
  in the binary and tracked via a `goose_db_version` table so only
  unapplied migrations run.

Engine-agnostic orchestration lives in `internal/store/core/` (transactional
business logic against a `TxAdapter` interface). Each engine package
(`internal/store/postgres/`, `internal/store/sqlite/`) is a thin adapter
that implements the same `TxAdapter`, so the same code drives both engines.

The schema currently provisions:

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `backend_quotas` | Per-backend byte limit and orphan bytes tracking |
| `backend_quota_stripes` | Each backend's stored byte total, split across rows so concurrent writes do not serialize on one |
| `object_locations` | Maps object keys to backends with size tracking. `size_bytes` counts what the backend holds, so the `compression_*` columns and `logical_size` are what describe the object it decodes to; a NULL algorithm means the bytes are stored verbatim. The `managed` flag is false for objects reconcile found outside every configured virtual bucket prefix: they count toward quota, but replication, rebalance, integrity and drain skip them |
| `object_tags` | One row per [tag](tagging.md) on an object, keyed `(object_key, tag_key)`. Keyed by object key alone, not by backend, because a tag set describes the object and per-replica rows would let copies of one key disagree. `idx_object_tags_lookup` on `(tag_key, tag_value)` serves the reverse lookup: which objects carry a given tag |
| `multipart_uploads` | In-progress multipart upload metadata, including the `tagging` column holding a query-string-encoded tag set from `CreateMultipartUpload` until the upload completes |
| `multipart_parts` | Individual parts for active multipart uploads |
| `backend_usage` | Monthly per-backend API request and data transfer counters. `api_requests` counts every call made, including operations no budget charges, so it stays an honest record of request volume |
| `backend_request_usage` | Monthly per-backend request counts keyed by the pool names config declares, which is what admission judges a request against. Pools are additive - an operation charges every pool containing it - so these do not sum to `backend_usage.api_requests` and are not a decomposition of it |
| `cleanup_queue` | Retry queue for failed backend object deletions |
| `cleanup_dlq` | Dead-letter for `cleanup_queue` rows that exhausted retries; surfaces unrecoverable orphans for operator action |
| `pending_objects` | In-flight PUT intents recorded before the backend write so a DB outage can't silently destroy the prior copy. Carries the same stored-form columns as `object_locations`, so an intent the reaper promotes describes bytes that can actually be read |
| `notification_outbox` | Durable webhook event delivery queue |

Quota updates are transactional: object location inserts/deletes and quota counter changes happen atomically.

`object_tags` carries no foreign key, because there is no table to point at: `object_locations` is keyed `(object_key, backend_name)` and nothing is keyed on object key alone, so `ON DELETE CASCADE` cannot express the relationship. The store clears the rows explicitly instead, in the same transaction and under the same key lock as the write that orphaned them - every path that puts a new object at a key or removes the last copy of one.

All Postgres SQL queries live in `internal/store/postgres/sqlc/queries/` as annotated `.sql` files. Type-safe Go code is generated by sqlc into `internal/store/postgres/sqlc/`. To regenerate after editing queries:

```bash
make generate
```
