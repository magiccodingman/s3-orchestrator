## Core Principles

- **ASCII-only characters** - Never use Unicode em-dashes, en-dashes, or box-drawing characters
- **Dashes, not equals** - Always use `-` for dividers, never `=`
- **Box comment spacing** - ALL box comments (79-char file headers and 73-char sections) ALWAYS have a blank line after
- **Professional tone** - No personal references, no numbered lists, no casual language
- **Self-documenting** - Code explains *why*, not just *what*
- **Streaming over buffering** - Use `io.Pipe` and streaming patterns for object data; never buffer entire objects in memory
- **Buffer pooling** - Use `bufpool.Copy` instead of `io.Copy` for all streaming I/O to reuse buffers and reduce GC pressure
- **Context propagation** - Pass `context.Context` through all function chains for cancellation, tracing, and audit correlation

## Comment Types and Spacing

### File Header (79 characters)

**Format:**
```go
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Title of File or Component
//
// Author: Alex Freidah
//
// 2-4 sentence description of the file's purpose, scope, and key functionality.
// Include architecture notes, design decisions, or important context that helps
// readers understand the overall purpose.
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

package mypackage
```

**Spacing Rules:**
- Blank line after title
- Blank line after metadata
- Blank line before closing divider
- **Blank line after closing divider** - always separate box from code

### Major Section Box (73 characters)

**Format:**
```go
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
// SECTION NAME
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------

func doSomething() {
    // ...
}
```

**Spacing Rules:**
- Use ALL CAPS for section name
- **Blank line AFTER closing divider** - separates section from code
- Used for major logical divisions (e.g., PUBLIC API, INTERNALS, TYPES)
- The box goes above the first declaration's doc comment, never between a doc comment and its declaration

**When to use them:**

Every file with more than one logical group of declarations carries section boxes, so a reader lands in a familiar shape whichever file they open. A file under roughly 100 lines with a single concern does not - a box per file is noise, not structure.

**Section vocabulary.** Prefer these names, in this order, so the same concept is not called three things across the tree:

| Section | Holds |
|---------|-------|
| `CONSTANTS` | package-level constant blocks |
| `TYPES` | the types a file declares |
| `INTERFACE` | a consumer-declared or role interface |
| `CONSTRUCTOR` | `New*` and the wiring it needs |
| *domain sections* | the file's actual work, named for it: `ADMISSION`, `FLUSH`, `LISTINGS`, `SCRUB QUEUE`, `UNDER-REPLICATION` |
| `LIFECYCLE` | `Close`, `Shutdown`, and other teardown |
| `INTERNALS` / `HELPERS` | unexported helpers the sections above call |

Domain sections carry the weight: a file with `LISTINGS` / `STATISTICS AND WRITES` / `INTERNALS` tells a reader more than one split into `PUBLIC API` / `PRIVATE`.

### Comments Inside Declaration Blocks

A comment line above a single entry inside a `struct`, `interface`, `const` or `var` block breaks the block's visual flow and makes a block that should read at a glance three times its height. Two forms are allowed instead:

- **End-of-line**, when the note is short:

```go
const (
	StateClosed   State = iota // healthy  -  all calls pass through
	StateOpen                  // down  -  return sentinel error
	StateHalfOpen              // probing  -  one call allowed through
)
```

- **In the block's doc comment**, when the note carries real reasoning:

```go
// ExistingCopy is the projection of an object_locations row that promotion
// and overwrite logic needs from a SELECT-for-update read.
//
// Encrypted and HasDEK say whether the row claims the bytes are an envelope and
// whether the key that reads them is still present. They are carried here so a
// decision about which copy to drop cannot destroy the last row able to decrypt
// the object.
type ExistingCopy struct {
	BackendName string
	SizeBytes   int64
	CreatedAt   time.Time
	Encrypted   bool
	HasDEK      bool
}
```

An entry whose name already says what it is gets no comment at all. `revive`'s `exported` rule is satisfied by the doc comment on the block, so moving the text up does not cost lint coverage.

### Single-Line Comments

Standard Go comments placed directly above the code they describe:

```go
// Parse request path
bucket, key, ok := parsePath(r.URL.Path)
if !ok {
    return errInvalidPath
}
```

- **NO blank line before code** - placed directly above the block
- Use lowercase or sentence case
- Used for minor divisions or labels within functions

### Inline Comments

```go
m.usage.Record(backendName, 2, movedSize, 0) // Get + Delete, egress
```

- Use sparingly
- Explain *why*, not *what*
- Keep concise (< 50 characters)

---

## Comment Type Decision Tree

```
Is this a file header?
  YES -> Use 79-char divider, blank line AFTER

Is this a major section (types, public API, internals)?
  YES -> Use 73-char box, blank line AFTER

Is this a minor division or label within a function?
  YES -> Use a standard single-line comment, NO blank line before code

Is this explaining a specific line?
  YES -> Use inline comment
```

**Key Rule:** ALL box comments (79-char and 73-char) have a blank line after. Single-line comments have no extra spacing.

---

## File Headers

Every `.go` file starts with a 79-char header block:

```go
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Object Operations - PUT, GET, HEAD, DELETE, COPY
//
// Author: Alex Freidah
//
// Object-level CRUD operations. Handles backend selection via routing
// strategy, read failover across replicas, broadcast reads during degraded
// mode, and usage limit enforcement on reads and writes.
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

package object
```

**Rules:**
- Use `//` comments (not `/* */` blocks)
- Title line describes the file's scope, not the package
- Description covers purpose, key behaviors, and dependencies
- The `package` declaration follows immediately after the closing divider + blank line

The blank line between the header and `package` is load-bearing: it keeps the box header a file comment rather than the package comment, so the package doc lives in one place (see below).

---

## Package Docs (doc.go)

The package-level godoc lives in a dedicated `doc.go`, the idiomatic Go pattern (`net/http`, `encoding/json`). It is the one file exempt from the box header: it opens directly with a `// Package X ...` comment adjacent to the `package` clause, so it - and only it - is the package comment. This is what renders as the package overview on the godoc site.

```go
// Package backend defines the ObjectBackend abstraction over the S3-compatible
// providers the orchestrator stores objects on, plus the wrappers that harden
// it ...
package backend
```

**Rules:**
- One sentence is the floor; pin the package's invariants and link out to the implementation files for per-symbol detail
- Only `doc.go` carries a package comment; every other file keeps its box header + blank line before `package`
- Every package has one, including `main` and test-only helper packages. A new package without a `doc.go` is incomplete

`go/doc` concatenates every package comment it finds, in file-name order, so a second one does not replace the first - it appends to it, and the rendered overview says the same thing twice. That is the reason for the one-file rule.

mockgen writes `// Package X is a generated GoMock package.` above the package clause of everything it emits. In a package whose mocks are `_test.go` files that never reaches godoc and is left alone; where they are not (`storetest`, `opstest`, `backendtest`), `make generate` strips it so `doc.go` stays the only package comment.

---

## Go Conventions

### Indentation

- **1 tab** - Go standard (`gofmt` enforced)

Formatting is a lint failure, not a convention: `make lint` runs `gofmt` and `goimports`, and `make fmt` applies both.

### Imports

Group imports in three blocks separated by blank lines:

```go
import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "time"

    "github.com/afreidah/s3-orchestrator/internal/observe/audit"
    "github.com/afreidah/s3-orchestrator/internal/observe/telemetry"

    "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/attribute"
    "github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus"
)
```

Order: stdlib, internal packages, external packages.

### Naming

- **Exported types** get standard Go doc comments placed directly above the declaration
- **Constants** grouped by concern with `const` blocks, named in `CamelCase`
- **Sentinel errors** use `Err` prefix: `ErrObjectNotFound`, `ErrDBUnavailable`
- **S3Error type** wraps HTTP status + S3 error code for typed error responses
- **Operation names** are consistent PascalCase strings matching S3 API names: `"PutObject"`, `"GetObject"`, `"CreateMultipartUpload"`

### Struct Organization

Group related fields with inline comments explaining non-obvious fields:

```go
type Manager struct {
    core        ObjectRuntime          // infrastructure subset: backends, usage, timeout, metrics
    coord       ObjectCoordinator      // write-path helpers, shared with the multipart manager
    stores      ObjectStores           // direct store access for read paths and quota inspection
    encryptor   *encryption.Encryptor  // nil when encryption is disabled
    cache       *LocationCache         // key -> backend, consulted only in degraded mode
    objectCache objcache.ObjectCache   // nil when object data caching is disabled
    failover    *readpath.Failover     // per-key read failover + degraded-mode broadcast

    integrityCfg *syncutil.AtomicConfig[config.IntegrityConfig] // shared with the multipart manager
}
```

### Interface Design: Consumer-Declared Interfaces

This codebase follows the Go-idiomatic "accept interfaces, return structs" pattern: **producer packages export concrete `*Type` values with no producer-side interface**, and **each consumer declares its own narrow interface** listing only the methods it actually calls. The concrete type satisfies every consumer's local interface because Go interfaces are structurally typed.

Applied across `internal/store` (the per-role store interfaces consumed at use sites), `internal/worker` (`Ops`, `CleanupOps`, `ScrubberOps` in `ops_runtime.go`), and the `internal/proxy/*` subpackages (`MultipartRuntime`/`MultipartCoordinator`, `ObjectRuntime`/`ObjectCoordinator`, `WriteRuntime`).

**Rationale:**
- A consumer's dependency footprint is documented in its own source file.
- Adding a method to a producer type never bloats existing consumer mocks.
- Tests can mock at the granularity of what is used (typically 4-10 methods), not the full producer surface.
- Aligns with Rob Pike's "accept interfaces, return structs" guideline.

**Trade-offs:**
- Each consumer declares its own small interface (extra text, but localized).
- The composition layer (the root `proxy` package, `internal/di`) still holds concrete types - it owns construction and is the seam where interfaces meet implementations.

**Where the interfaces live:**

| Location | Holds |
|---|---|
| `internal/proxy/<consumer>/consumer_interfaces.go` | All narrow interfaces this consumer declares against other proxy subpackages and external clients |
| `internal/worker/ops_runtime.go` | Worker-side `Ops` / `CleanupOps` / `ScrubberOps` interfaces against the proxy infrastructure |
| `internal/store/core/interfaces.go` | Per-role narrow store interfaces (consumers compose them when they need to declare a minimal store dependency) |

**Naming convention:** `<Consumer><Provider>` - e.g. the multipart subpackage's view of `*infra.BackendRuntime` is `MultipartRuntime`; the object subpackage's view of `*writepath.Coordinator` is `ObjectCoordinator`. The prefix names the consumer, the suffix names the producer concept.

**Constructor shape:** consumers take the interfaces, not concrete pointers. Composition-layer code (the root proxy package, DI providers) passes the concrete `*infra.BackendRuntime`, `*writepath.Coordinator`, `*object.Manager`, etc., and the concrete types satisfy the interfaces implicitly.

```go
// internal/proxy/multipart/consumer_interfaces.go
type MultipartRuntime interface {
    GetBackend(name string) (backend.ObjectBackend, error)
    Usage() *counter.UsageTracker
    WithTimeout(ctx context.Context) (context.Context, context.CancelFunc)
    // ... only what multipart calls
}

// internal/proxy/multipart/manager.go
type Manager struct {
    core  MultipartRuntime        // not *infra.BackendRuntime
    coord MultipartCoordinator // not *writepath.Coordinator
    // ...
}

func New(core MultipartRuntime, coord MultipartCoordinator, ...) *Manager { ... }
```

**Mocking:** generated mocks are not produced eagerly. When a test actually needs to mock a consumer-declared interface, add a `//go:generate mockgen -source=consumer_interfaces.go -destination=mock/<file>.go -package=<pkg>mock` directive at the top of the consumer interface file and run `make generate`. Until a mock is needed, the interface declaration alone documents the dependency surface - generating unused mocks is busywork.

**When NOT to declare a narrow interface (#918).** A consumer-side interface earns its keep when at least one of these is true:

1. **Multiple implementations actually exist** (a real polymorphism point, e.g. `keySource` over S3 iter + DB iter).
2. **A test fake genuinely benefits from the seam** - a hand-rolled fake or `gomock`-generated mock that lets tests exercise the consumer without standing up the real producer (e.g. `worker.Ops` mocked across ~60 test sites; `admin.ReplicatorOps`/`OverReplicationOps`/`ScrubberOps`/`Reconciler` whose fakes drive admin handler branches).
3. **An import cycle would otherwise form** (e.g. `readpath.LocationCache` - without the interface, `readpath` would have to import `object` which already imports `readpath`).
4. **The interface models a real domain boundary** between subsystems (`drain.DrainRuntime`, `MultipartRuntime`, `ObjectRuntime`, `WriteRuntime`).

If none apply - single impl, single consumer, no test fake, no cycle, no boundary - pass the concrete `*Type` directly. Examples cut under #918: `readpath.ObjectLocationLister`, `multipart.MultipartCoordinator`, `multipart.StaleCleaner`, `accounting.UsageTracker`.

**There is no exported union of the store roles.** A type that unions every per-role interface is a god interface, and an exported one in the package every consumer already imports is an invitation to take it as a dependency. So the union exists in exactly three places, none of them reachable from a feature package:

- `core.engineRoles`, unexported, and a generic constraint rather than an interface: `core.AssertEngine[*Store]` is how each engine states it implements everything, and a constraint cannot be a variable type, so nothing can depend on it.
- `internal/di.metadataStore`, unexported, because the composition root genuinely has to hold one opened engine before aliasing it into roles.
- `storetest.MetadataStore`, the mockgen target, so one generated mock stands in wherever a test needs a fully-populated store.

The union is not a fact about the domain: nothing in persistence requires one object to implement all seventeen roles, and a design that split persistence across several objects would satisfy every role interface and violate nothing. What it encodes is that there happens to be one store type per engine, which is wiring rather than domain.

Every feature package under `internal/proxy/*`, `internal/worker/`, `internal/transport/*` declares its own role-composite naming exactly the per-role interfaces it needs:

  ```go
  // internal/worker/scrubber.go
  type ScrubberStore interface {
      core.IntegrityStore
  }

  // internal/proxy/writepath/coordinator.go
  type Stores interface {
      core.ObjectStore
      core.QuotaStore
      core.PendingStore
      core.CleanupStore
  }
  ```

  Each concrete store satisfies every such composite implicitly, so DI wiring stays one line per provider while each consumer's dependency footprint is documented in its own source file. A package that took the whole surface would give the misleading impression it might call any DB role, and auditing what it actually touches would then mean reading the implementation.

**Producer-side interfaces are an anti-pattern.** `*infra.BackendRuntime`, `*writepath.Coordinator`, `*object.Manager`, `*multipart.Manager` are exported as concrete pointer types with no sibling `Core`/`Coordinator`/`Manager` interface that mirrors their public surface. Producer-side interfaces force every consumer to mock the full producer API, which is exactly what this pattern is built to avoid.

**Logger is not a behavior dependency.** Never include `Log() *slog.Logger` in a consumer-declared interface. The logger is observability infrastructure: it has no return value the consumer depends on, and the per-component scope is a property of the consumer itself, not of the producer. Components build their own `log *slog.Logger` field in the constructor body via `slog.Default().With(logfmt.Component("<slug>"))` (see Logging and Audit), so each subsystem owns its component name and tests do not need to thread a logger through dependency interfaces.

**Single-method interface names follow the Go `-er` convention.** A single-method interface is named after its method, with the verb in agent-noun form: `Read` -> `Reader`, `Close` -> `Closer`, `Stringer` for `String()`. Names ending in `-Ops`, `-Store`, `-ing`, or other shapes that do not describe an actor get flagged by `golangci-lint` / sonar (rule S8196) and should be renamed:

| Method | Good | Bad |
|---|---|---|
| `Read(p []byte) (int, error)` | `Reader` | `IOOps` |
| `Close() error` | `Closer` | `Closeable` |
| `GetAllObjectLocations(...)` | `ObjectLocationLister` | `LocationStore` |
| `CleanupStaleMultipartUploads(...)` | `staleMultipartCleaner` | `multipartCleanupOps` |
| `UpdateUsageLimits(...)` | `usageLimitsApplier` | `usageLimitsHook` |
| `UpdateQuotaMetrics(...)` | `quotaMetricsRefresher` | `metricsHook` |

For interfaces that exist to *provide* a value (typical "Acct" / "Stores" / "Config" getters), name the interface after the returned type plus `Provider` or `Source` - `RecorderProvider` for `Acct() *Recorder`, `ConfigSource` for `Config() *Config`. The `Provider` / `Source` suffix is also an agent noun and satisfies the rule.

Multi-method interfaces are exempt: `worker.Ops`, `ObjectRuntime`, `MultipartCoordinator` describe a role (or a composite of sub-roles), not a single action, so the `-er` form does not apply.

### Where new methods live

The split is by **persistence coupling**:

- **`infra.BackendRuntime`** owns methods that touch only backend objects,
  in-memory usage counters, admission, timeouts, error classification, and
  metrics - no `store.X` calls. Keeping them store-free is what lets every
  worker reuse the runtime through the role interfaces without dragging the
  metadata-store dependency along.
- **A collaborator under `internal/proxy/*`** owns methods that read or write
  the metadata store, open transactions, or coordinate more than one of the
  others. `object`, `multipart`, `writepath`, `drain` and `usage` each own a
  slice of that, and each takes the store roles it needs directly.

When in doubt: if the method needs the store, it belongs to whichever
collaborator owns that concern, not to the runtime. There is no root object
to fall back on, which is the point - a method with no obvious owner is a sign
the concern has no home yet, rather than a reason to make one type hold it.

### Per-Backend Accounting: Use the Recorder

Per-backend usage and per-operation metric accounting flow through one shared helper: `internal/proxy/accounting.Recorder`. Every consumer holds the same `*accounting.Recorder` (resolved via `core.Acct()`) and calls the named methods rather than the underlying `Usage().Record(...)` or `RecordOperation(...)`:

| Intent | Use | Avoid |
|---|---|---|
| Backend call attempted, no bytes (success or failure) | `acct.APICall(backend)` | `Usage().Record(b, 1, 0, 0)` |
| N backend calls (paginated lists, multipart bulks) | `acct.APICalls(backend, n)` | `Usage().Record(b, n, 0, 0)` |
| Successful GET-like (bytes left the backend) | `acct.Egress(backend, size)` | `Usage().Record(b, 1, size, 0)` |
| Successful PUT-like (bytes arrived at the backend) | `acct.Ingress(backend, size)` | `Usage().Record(b, 1, 0, size)` |
| Per-operation Prometheus histogram | `acct.Operation(op, backend, start, err)` | `RecordOperation(op, b, start, err)` |
| Common combo: Operation + Ingress | `acct.PutSuccess(op, backend, size, start)` | both above, two lines |
| Common combo: Operation + Egress | `acct.GetSuccess(op, backend, size, start)` | both above, two lines |
| The call reached the backend and failed | `acct.OperationFailed(op, backend, start, err)` | Operation + APICall, two lines |

The cardinal rule "every backend call costs one API-call charge regardless of outcome" lives in the method bodies, not in repeated inline comments at every call site. The argument-order risk of the bare `Record(b, 1, 0, size)` vs `Record(b, 1, size, 0)` form is eliminated because ingress vs egress is named in the method.

Exceptions - *not* every Usage call goes through Recorder:
- The operations layer's bulk passes take a `UsageGate` and call `Record(b, apiCalls, egress, ingress)` on the tracker with an arbitrary tuple. That bypasses the per-attempt rule on purpose: a fleet-wide rewrite asks once and spends in units the Recorder has no name for.
- Tests that exercise the tracker's own semantics (`manager_usage_test.go`) call `Usage().Record` directly - they're verifying the tracker, not the accounting rule.

### Variable Naming

Avoid shadowing package imports with local variable names. When a function receives or creates a `backend.ObjectBackend`, name the variable `be`, not `backend`:

```go
// Good
be, err := mp.GetBackend(mu.BackendName)
etag, err := be.PutObject(ctx, key, body, size, contentType, nil)

// Bad - shadows the backend package import
backend, err := mp.GetBackend(mu.BackendName)
```

### Typed Constants

Use typed string constants for values compared in multiple places. Bare string comparisons (e.g., `routingStrategy == "spread"`) are error-prone:

```go
type RoutingStrategy string

const (
    RoutingPack   RoutingStrategy = "pack"
    RoutingSpread RoutingStrategy = "spread"
)
```

### No Empty Cleanup Funcs

Never return `func() {}` to satisfy a `(T, cleanup func(), error)` signature when the "no-cleanup" branch has nothing to do. SonarQube flags empty function literals (rule `go:S1186`) and the empty literal hides whether the branch *meant* to be empty or someone forgot to wire the cleanup.

**Why:** Past SonarQube findings on PRs that returned `func() {}` as the no-op cleanup arm of an in-memory-vs-tempfile sink. The repo has hit the same lint multiple times across different abstractions.

**How to apply:** Attach the cleanup as a method on the returned type so the caller writes `defer x.Cleanup()` once and the method internally branches on which underlying resource (if any) actually needs releasing. The lint never sees an empty literal, and the caller code stays identical across branches.

```go
// Bad - empty literal trips S1186 on the in-memory branch.
func newSink(size int64) (*sink, func(), error) {
    if size <= memoryLimit {
        return &sink{buf: &bytes.Buffer{}}, func() {}, nil
    }
    f, _ := os.CreateTemp("", "x-*")
    return &sink{file: f}, func() { _ = f.Close() }, nil
}

// Good - cleanup is a method that no-ops on the branch with no resource.
func newSink(size int64) (*sink, error) {
    if size <= memoryLimit {
        return &sink{buf: &bytes.Buffer{}}, nil
    }
    f, err := os.CreateTemp("", "x-*")
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    return &sink{file: f}, nil
}

func (s *sink) Cleanup() {
    if s.file != nil {
        _ = s.file.Close()
    }
}
```

When the cleanup truly must be a callback (e.g., interface contract), wrap it in `sync.OnceFunc` and have it do something meaningful (clear a pointer, decrement a counter) so the body is never literally empty.

### Concurrency Patterns

- **`syncutil.AtomicConfig[T]`** for hot-reloadable config (wraps `atomic.Pointer[T]` with `Store`/`Load`)
- **`syncutil.TTLCache[K,V]`** for generic TTL-based caches with background eviction
- **Atomic counters** for usage tracking, flushed periodically to the database
- **Context-scoped timeouts** via helper methods (`m.WithTimeout(ctx)`) for backend calls
- **Graceful shutdown** via `context.WithCancel` + signal handling

## Project Structure and Layers

The codebase splits along strict layers. New code goes in the layer whose
responsibility matches; an outer layer must not import a more outer layer, and
inner layers must never import the transport packages.

### Layer Responsibilities

| Layer | Imports | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `cmd/`, `cli/` | Everything | Wire flags, build the DI injector, invoke top-level services |
| `transport/` | `proxy`, `auth`, `observe` | Decode HTTP, authenticate, dispatch to manager, encode S3-XML response |
| `proxy/` | `worker`, `store`, `backend`, `observe`, `counter` | Routing strategy, broadcast reads, location cache, worker hosts |
| `worker/` | `store`, `backend`, `observe` | Background services driven by the lifecycle manager |
| `store/` | nothing app-specific | Metadata persistence; engine-agnostic orchestration in `core/`, engines under `postgres/` and `sqlite/` |
| `backend/` | nothing app-specific | Per-provider S3 client wrappers behind one `ObjectBackend` interface |
| `observe/` | nothing app-specific | Logging, tracing, metrics, audit |
| `di/` | All public surfaces | Single wiring point that registers every provider |

Inner layers must not import outer layers (no `store` importing `transport`).
The compiler does not enforce this, so reviewers must - it is the rule that
keeps the code testable and the dependency graph acyclic.

### Layered Read of a Single PUT

```
client -> transport/s3api  (parse, auth)
       -> proxy/manager    (routing, quota check, location cache)
       -> backend          (S3 PUT)
       -> store/core       (RecordObject in a tx)
       -> response back through the layers
```

The arrow direction is strict: `store/core` never calls back into `proxy`.

---

## Dependency Injection

DI uses [samber/do/v2](https://github.com/samber/do/v2) and is centralised
in `internal/di/di.go`. Every external dependency, store role, worker, and
top-level handler has a `Provide<Name>` function registered there. Callers
resolve dependencies via `do.Invoke[Foo](inj)` at the moment they are
needed; nothing is constructed until it is asked for.

### Two Foundational Rules

1. **Lazy providers**: a provider returns the dependency it builds; it
   never has side effects beyond construction. The injector calls it on
   the first `do.Invoke` and memoises the result for subsequent calls.
2. **Role interfaces at the boundary**: `di` holds the opened engine as
   the unexported `metadataStore` and passes it into each constructor,
   where it lands in the narrow role composite that consumer declared.
   Nothing outside `di` can name the wide type, so a consumer's
   dependency footprint is whatever roles it wrote down.

### Provider Pattern

Every provider follows the same shape:

```go
// ProvideRebalancer constructs the rebalancer worker.
func ProvideRebalancer(i do.Injector) (*worker.Rebalancer, error) {
    c, err := resolveWorkerCore(i)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    // Fleet primitives come from the runtime; the write coordinator
    // supplies the Placement facet (target selection, delete/move).
    return worker.NewRebalancer(c.Runtime, c.Coord, c.Stores), nil
}
```

Providers take a `do.Injector`, resolve their own dependencies through it,
and return either the value or an error. They never panic, never log, and
never spawn goroutines. CB protection lives inside each driver's DBTX/DB
chokepoint, so providers do not wrap stores with per-role decorators.

### Wiring Point

The `internal/di` package is the single wiring point. It is the **only**
package that imports the concrete engine packages (`store/postgres`,
`store/sqlite`, each backend driver, etc.). Providers are split across
focused files by concern:

- `injector.go` - `NewInjector` and the top-level registration order
- `store.go`    - database, role aliases, instance ID, metrics deps
- `backend.go`  - S3 backends, breaker registry, backend manager, and the
                  optional providers feeding it (encryption, Redis counters,
                  object cache)
- `workers.go`  - background worker providers
- `lifecycle.go` - lifecycle manager and per-mode service registration
- `transport.go` - S3, admin, UI, notifier, rate limiter, login throttle
- `optional.go`  - `invokeOptional[T]` and `resolveOptional*` helpers
- `services.go`  - lifecycle Runner wrappers (locked-ticker background jobs)

New providers go in the file matching their concern, with `73-char`
section dividers when a single file hosts multiple groups.

### Consuming a Service

The transport layer and CLI commands resolve services from the injector:

```go
func (h *Handler) handleAdminReplicate(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    repl, err := do.Invoke[*worker.Replicator](h.inj)
    if err != nil {
        writeError(w, http.StatusInternalServerError, err)
        return
    }
    n, err := repl.Replicate(r.Context(), repl.Config())
    // ...
}
```

The handler holds `do.Injector`, not the resolved service - that keeps
the handler decoupled from concrete provider behaviour and lets tests
substitute fakes by registering a different provider.

### Adding a New Provider

1. Add a `Provide<Name>` function in the appropriate section of
   `internal/di/di.go`.
2. Inside the function, call `do.Invoke[Dep](i)` for each dependency.
3. Construct the new component and return `(value, nil)`.
4. If the new component is consumed somewhere, the consumer should call
   `do.Invoke[Name](inj)` rather than holding the value as a field.

### Optional Providers

Some providers register only when a feature is enabled (encryption,
Redis counters, UI, notifications) or only in specific run modes
(reconciler is worker/all-only). Consumers that may run in either mode
use the `invokeOptional[T]` helper, which returns the zero value of `T`
when the service is not registered:

```go
return admin.New(&admin.Deps{
    // ... required deps from resolveAdminHandlerRequiredDeps
    Reconciler: invokeOptional[*worker.Reconciler](i),
})
```

Required providers should still bail with the `do.Invoke` error so a
genuinely missing dependency surfaces at boot, not at first use.

### Anti-Patterns

- Constructing a real dependency in a constructor that already has a
  provider. Always go through `do.Invoke`.
- Passing a `*slog.Logger` through the constructor argument list.
  Long-lived components hold a private `log *slog.Logger` field set
  inside the constructor body via
  `slog.Default().With(logfmt.Component("name"))`. Metrics use the
  `observe/telemetry` package-level vars directly. Free helper
  functions call `slog.XContext(ctx, ...)` directly. See
  [`docs/contributing/logging.md`](contributing/logging.md).
- Storing the injector as a field on a non-handler struct. Workers,
  managers, and stores receive their dependencies as constructor args
  resolved in the provider; only handlers (HTTP/CLI entry points) carry
  the injector itself. Adding a store method has its own mechanical
  checklist, in
  [`docs/contributing/store.md`](contributing/store.md).

### Constructor Patterns

**Parameter threshold.** A constructor with **four or more parameters**, or
with two or more same-typed primitives (bool/int/string) whose call-site
order is ambiguous, takes a single `Deps` (dependency bag) or `Config`
(value config) struct instead of a positional list - named fields document
each argument and make transposition impossible. `context.Context` stays
the first positional argument, never inside the struct; three or fewer
distinct-typed parameters stay positional. Pass the struct by pointer when
it is large (`gocritic` flags structs over ~80 bytes), by value otherwise.
A flat `Deps` is the default. Capability sub-structs, grouping fields by
where they come from, are reserved for genuinely large configs - and are
worth a second look before reaching for: the last one grew four sub-structs
that nothing read, which stayed invisible because a config nobody reads still
compiles.

Constructors at the DI/wiring boundary panic on missing required
dependencies via `internal/util/must`. The boundary is the set of
constructors a DI provider or a test fixture builds directly:
every `worker.New*`, every `transport/{s3api,admin,ui}.New*`, and the
`proxy/{drain,readpath,multipart,object,writepath,usage}` package
constructors that take a `*Deps` or interface bag. Internal helpers that are only called from one
already-validated site (`accounting.New`, `metrics.New`,
`dashboard.New`, `infra.New`) trust their caller and skip the panic.

```go
func New(d *Deps) *Handler {
    must.NotNil("d", d)
    must.NotNil("d.BackendOps", d.BackendOps)
    must.NotNil("d.Objects", d.Objects)
    ...
    return &Handler{...}
}
```

Why panic rather than return `(*T, error)`: a wiring bug is a programmer
error, not an operator-recoverable condition. The panic surfaces at boot
with a clear "required dependency X is nil" message; the alternative
defers to the NPE that fires several call frames deep on the first
request. Operator-facing config invariants (negative timeouts, missing
required strings) belong in `internal/config.SetDefaultsAndValidate`
which returns errors the loader can format and report.

**Fallible-constructor exemption.** Constructors that legitimately
fail at boot for I/O, parsing, or network reasons keep the
`(*T, error)` signature and do not use `must.NotNil`. Examples:
`httputil.NewCertReloader` (reads cert files),
`httpserver.New` (binds a port). The DI provider chains the error
upstream.

**When NOT to use `must.NotNil`.** It is for already-resolved internal
dependencies whose absence is a programmer wiring bug - nothing else. Do
not reach for it on:

- values derived from config or user input (validate in `internal/config.SetDefaultsAndValidate` and return an error);
- network clients, file paths, or external services that can fail at runtime;
- optional or feature-gated dependencies - use `Optional[T]` or an explicit nil-check rather than panicking.

The test: if a nil here could result from anything other than a developer
mis-wiring the program, return an error instead of panicking.

**Tests must satisfy the boundary.** When a test constructs one of
these types directly, it provides real or `gomock`-generated deps for
every required field. Don't loosen production validation to fit lazy
test wiring; widen the test fixture instead. The shared fixtures in
`internal/proxy/proxytest`, `internal/testutil`, and the per-package
`newTestHandler*` helpers exist for this purpose.

## Adding a New Component

Each component type has a fixed checklist; following it keeps the code
shape uniform across contributors.

### Adding a New Backend

1. Implement the `backend.ObjectBackend` interface in
   `internal/backend/<name>.go`. Constructor is `New<Name>(cfg config.BackendConfig)`.
2. Add the new backend type to the config validator in
   `internal/config/backends.go`.
3. Wire it into the backend factory in `internal/di/di.go` so existing
   `ProvideBackends` returns the new type when configured.
4. Add a unit test in `internal/backend/<name>_test.go`. Integration
   coverage comes from the existing MinIO testcontainer suite for any
   S3-compatible provider.
5. Update `README.md` and `docs/configuration.md` config sections.

### Adding a New Store Role

The narrow-role layering means new operations slot into one of the
existing role interfaces in `internal/store/core/interfaces.go`, or - if
they truly belong to a new bounded concern - into a new role.

1. Add the SQL in `internal/store/postgres/sqlc/queries/<role>.sql` and
   the matching method in `internal/store/sqlite/<role>.go`.
2. Run `make generate` to regenerate the sqlc-typed wrappers.
3. Surface the operation on the role interface in
   `internal/store/core/interfaces.go`. If business logic spans multiple
   tables or transactions, add the orchestration to
   `internal/store/core/<topic>.go` against `TxAdapter` so both engines
   share one implementation.
4. Add the CB-decorator method in `internal/store/cb_<role>.go`.
5. Update `MockStore` in `internal/testutil/mock_store.go` and any
   handwritten test mocks (`internal/proxy/mock_store_test.go` etc.).
6. Add a `Provide<Role>` provider in `internal/di/di.go` if it is a new
   role; otherwise the existing provider already covers it.
7. Schema changes are written twice, once per engine, and both engines pin the
   version they expect:

   **PostgreSQL** - add `internal/store/postgres/migrations/000NN_*.sql` and
   bump `postgres.ExpectedSchemaVersion` to the new migration number.

   **SQLite** - add `internal/store/sqlite/migrations/000NN_*.sql`, apply the
   same change to `internal/store/sqlite/schema.sql`, and bump both
   `sqlite.expectedSchemaVersion` and the `INSERT INTO schema_version` value at
   the bottom of `schema.sql`.

   Both files are needed because they serve different databases. `schema.sql`
   is the baseline a fresh database is created from; the numbered migration is
   what an existing database is upgraded through. A change made in only one of
   them means a new install and an upgraded install disagree, which is the kind
   of drift nothing notices until an operator hits it.

   Migrations are named `<version>_<description>.sql`; the runner reads the
   version from the file name, applies every migration above the recorded
   version in order, and writes the version row in the same transaction as the
   migration itself.

   Data repair belongs in a migration too, not in a startup pass. A one-off
   fixup that runs on every boot is unversioned, unrecorded, and invisible to
   the operator whose data it rewrites.

   Missing a version bump leaves the binary refusing to start against a
   database it just migrated, and only the integration suite catches it: those
   tests are behind `//go:build integration`, so `go test ./...` compiles and
   passes without them. Verify schema work with `make integration-test`.

### Adding a New Worker

1. Implement the worker in `internal/worker/<name>.go`. Define a narrow
   ops interface (e.g. `<Name>Ops`) and a narrow store interface
   (e.g. `<Name>WorkerStore`); the worker takes both as constructor args.
2. The worker exposes `Run(ctx) error` (long-lived) or `Process<X>(ctx)`
   (called per tick) - lifetime determines which.
3. Register a `Provide<Name>` provider in `internal/di/di.go`.
4. Register the worker with the lifecycle manager in `registerWorkerServices`
   inside `di.go`. Long-lived workers go through `lifecycle.Manager`;
   periodic workers wrap a ticker and an advisory lock.
5. Add metrics in a per-worker file under
   `internal/observe/telemetry/metrics_<worker>.go` if needed.

### Adding a New HTTP Handler

1. Define the handler in the appropriate `internal/transport/` sub-
   package. Handler signatures are `func (h *Handler) handle<X>(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)`.
2. The handler resolves its dependencies through the injector held on
   `*Handler`; it never constructs services itself.
3. Authentication middleware is applied at the `Server` level - do not
   reimplement auth inside individual handlers.
4. Audit-log every state-changing request via `audit.Log(ctx, "<event>", ...)`.
5. Update `docs/api-reference.md` for any new admin or UI endpoint.

### Adding a New Metric

1. Add the metric variable in the appropriate
   `internal/observe/telemetry/metrics_<domain>.go` file using
   `promauto.NewXxx`. Group by domain (cleanup, replication, breaker,
   etc.) - do not create a global metrics file.
2. Use the `s3o_<domain>_<noun>_<unit>` naming convention. Counters
   end in `_total`. Histograms end in `_seconds` or `_bytes`. Gauges
   take no suffix.
3. Add the metric to the dashboard JSON if it is operator-facing
   (`grafana/s3-orchestrator.json`).
4. Document the metric in `docs/monitoring.md`.

## Error Handling

### S3 Errors

Use the `S3Error` type for errors that map to S3 HTTP responses:

```go
var ErrObjectNotFound = &S3Error{
    StatusCode: 404,
    Code:       "NoSuchKey",
    Message:    "The specified key does not exist",
}
```

Handlers use `writeStorageError` to convert `S3Error` instances into XML responses. Untyped errors fall back to `502 InternalError`.

### Error Classification

The `classifyWriteError` helper distinguishes database unavailability (circuit breaker open) from other failures, returning appropriate S3 error codes:

- `ErrDBUnavailable` -> `503 ServiceUnavailable`
- Other errors -> `502 InternalError`

### Background Operation Errors

Background workers (rebalancer, replicator, cleanup) log errors and continue rather than crashing. Individual item failures are logged with `slog.Warn` and skipped; the batch proceeds with remaining items.

---

## Logging and Audit

All logs are structured `log/slog` JSON with the JSON handler set in
`internal/cli/serve/serve.go` `initLogging`. The full operational
logging conventions (helper package, attribute glossary, banned keys,
component scoping, outcome rollups) live in
[`docs/contributing/logging.md`](contributing/logging.md). This
section is the short summary; the contributing doc is the source of
truth.

### Structured operational logs

Every long-lived component holds a `*slog.Logger` field initialised
once in its constructor with the canonical `component` attribute:

```go
type PendingReaper struct {
    deps      CleanupOps
    placement Placement
    store     PendingReaperStore
    log       *slog.Logger
    // ...
}

func NewPendingReaper(deps CleanupOps, placement Placement, store PendingReaperStore, concurrency int, minAge time.Duration, batchSize int) *PendingReaper {
    return &PendingReaper{
        deps:      deps,
        placement: placement,
        store:     store,
        log:       slog.Default().With(logfmt.Component("pending_reaper")),
        // ...
    }
}

r.log.WarnContext(ctx, "HEAD probe failed, leaving intent for next tick",
    "backend", p.BackendName,
    "key", p.ObjectKey,
    "intent_id", p.IntentID,
    logfmt.Err(err),
)
```

Three rules every call site must follow:

1. **Always render errors through `logfmt.Err`.** Passing `"error", err`
   directly serialises the error struct as `{}` in the JSON handler,
   which JS log viewers render as `[object Object]`, hiding the actual
   failure mode from operators.
2. **Component is an attribute, not a message prefix.** Messages are
   plain English ("HEAD probe failed"), not "Pending reaper: HEAD
   probe failed". The `component` attr added by the scoped logger
   makes every line filterable in Loki/Grafana without text matching.
3. **Use the canonical attribute glossary** in
   `docs/contributing/logging.md`. The CI lint rejects banned keys
   (`err`, `from_backend`, `remote_addr`, etc.).

`golangci-lint` enforces `context: all` on every `slog` call, snake-case
keys, and the banned-key list. See `.golangci.yml` for the active
sloglint configuration.

### Audit Logging

The `internal/observe/audit` package emits a separate stream of
structured entries marked `"audit": true` for security-relevant
operations. Audit logs are not subject to the operational-log
conventions above and continue to use `slog.LogAttrs` directly.

**S3 API requests** produce two correlated audit entries sharing the
same `request_id`:

- HTTP layer (`s3.PutObject`, `s3.GetObject`, etc.) - method, path,
  bucket, status, duration.
- Storage layer (`storage.PutObject`, `storage.GetObject`, etc.) -
  key, backend, size.

Both also carry `user`, the identity the request authenticated as.
`audit.Log` reads it and the request id from context, so no call site
passes either and the storage-layer entry carries the same pair as the
HTTP-layer one without being handed an identity. An entry with no
`user` authenticated no caller: a rejected request, or a background
worker acting on its own.

**Internal operations** generate their own correlation IDs:

```go
ctx = audit.WithRequestID(ctx, audit.NewID())
audit.Log(ctx, "rebalance.start",
    slog.String("strategy", cfg.Strategy),
    slog.Int("batch_size", cfg.BatchSize),
)
```

**Rules:**
- Use `audit.Log` for operations that change state or serve data (not
  for debug/health checks).
- Always pass context so the request ID propagates.
- Event names use dotted notation: `"s3.PutObject"`,
  `"storage.DeleteObject"`, `"rebalance.move"`.
- Include enough attributes to reconstruct the operation without
  reading other log lines.

### Request ID Propagation

Request IDs flow through context via `audit.WithRequestID` /
`audit.RequestID`. The `logfmt` package's init wires `audit.RequestID`
as the accessor `logfmt.RequestIDFromCtx` reads, so worker logs can
surface the inbound request ID without importing the audit package
directly.

- S3 API requests: extracted from `X-Request-Id` header or generated,
  set on context before auth.
- Internal operations: generated at the start of each background task
  tick or batch run.
- The ID is also set as a `s3o.request_id` attribute on OpenTelemetry
  spans.
- `trace_id` and `span_id` are automatically injected into JSON log
  output by `telemetry.TraceHandler` for any log call with an active
  span in context - use `*Context` slog variants
  (`InfoContext`/`WarnContext`/`ErrorContext`).

### Log Levels

| Level | Use |
|-------|-----|
| `slog.LevelDebug` | Verbose state; off by default. |
| `slog.LevelInfo`  | Lifecycle (startup/shutdown), terminal success of a notable operation, audit entries. |
| `slog.LevelWarn`  | Recoverable failure - caller proceeds, operator should know (failover, degraded mode, retry-able errors). |
| `slog.LevelError` | Unrecoverable failure of an operation - request fails, background tick aborts, integrity violation. |

---

## Tracing

OpenTelemetry tracing is wired in `internal/observe/telemetry`. Every
S3 request, manager call, backend call, and significant background tick
produces a span; spans inherit the request id from `audit.RequestID(ctx)`
so log lines and traces cross-link.

### Starting a Span

Use `telemetry.StartSpan` rather than the OTel API directly. The helper
guarantees the `s3o.request_id` attribute is set when the context carries
one and that the span is registered on the global tracer:

```go
ctx, span := telemetry.StartSpan(ctx, "Manager PutObject",
    telemetry.AttrOperation.String("PutObject"),
    telemetry.AttrBackend.String(backendName),
)
defer span.End()
```

Always defer `span.End()` on the line after the `StartSpan` call so an
early return cannot leave the span open.

### Span Naming

Span names are stable strings (no per-request data) so traces aggregate
cleanly:

| Layer | Prefix | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Manager | `Manager <Op>` | `Manager PutObject`, `Manager GetObject` |
| Backend | `Backend <Op>` | `Backend PutObject`, `Backend GetObject` |
| Background worker | `<Worker>.<Op>` | `Replicator.Replicate`, `CleanupWorker.ProcessCleanupQueue` |
| Store engine | `<Engine> <Op>` | `Postgres RecordObject`, `SQLite ListObjects` |

The `Manager `/`Backend ` prefixes are constants (`managerSpanPrefix`,
`spanPrefix`) so the layer attribution stays consistent if the prefix
ever changes.

### Attributes

Standard attribute keys live in `internal/observe/telemetry/attrs.go` so
every span uses the same string. Add new keys there rather than inlining
strings at call sites.

```go
span.SetAttributes(
    telemetry.AttrBackend.String(backendName),
    telemetry.AttrObjectSize.Int64(size),
)
```

High-cardinality values (object keys, request IDs as attributes) are
allowed only on leaf spans. Do not put object keys on long-running
worker spans because that explodes trace storage cardinality.

### Recording Errors

Span errors are recorded via the OTel `RecordError` + `SetStatus` pair
so trace UIs flag the span as failing. Do not log the error inside the
span block - the audit/slog log line already carries the error and
trace correlation links the two.

```go
if err != nil {
    span.RecordError(err)
    span.SetStatus(codes.Error, err.Error())
    return err
}
```

### Trace-to-Log Correlation

Every `slog.InfoContext`, `WarnContext`, `ErrorContext` call inside an
active span automatically attaches `trace_id` and `span_id` fields via
`telemetry.TraceHandler`. This is why context-aware slog must be used
(see Logging and Audit). Never use `slog.Info` (no context) when an
active span exists - that produces a log line with no trace correlation.

---

## Metrics

Prometheus metrics live in `internal/observe/telemetry/metrics_*.go`,
one file per domain. The `promauto` constructors register the metric
with the default registry on package init; nothing else needs to be
called to make a metric visible at `/metrics`.

### Naming

| Type | Format | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Counter | `s3o_<domain>_<noun>_total{labels}` | `s3o_cleanup_queue_enqueued_total{reason}` |
| Gauge | `s3o_<domain>_<noun>{labels}` | `s3o_cleanup_dlq_depth` |
| Histogram | `s3o_<domain>_<noun>_seconds` or `_bytes` | `s3o_request_duration_seconds` |

The `s3o_` prefix is mandatory so a multi-service Prometheus instance
can pick out orchestrator metrics with one label match. The unit suffix
goes at the end (`_seconds`, `_bytes`, `_total`) to match Prometheus
conventions.

### File Layout

Group metrics by domain in `internal/observe/telemetry/metrics_<domain>.go`.
Existing domains: `audit`, `breaker`, `cache`, `cleanup`, `encryption`,
`meta`, `quota`, `rebalance`, `replication`, `request`. Add a new file
when a new feature has its own logical domain - do not append to a
random existing file just to avoid creating one.

Each metric variable carries a 2-3 line godoc explaining what it
measures and which dashboard panel reads it.

### Label Cardinality

Labels multiply storage cost. Hard rules:

- **Allowed labels**: `backend`, `operation`, `status`, `reason`,
  enumerated states. These come from a small fixed set per dimension.
- **Forbidden labels**: `key`, `request_id`, `user`, IP, anything
  user-supplied or identity-bearing. These create unbounded label
  cardinality and will eventually crash Prometheus.
- Buckets for histograms must be explicit (`prometheus.LinearBuckets`
  or `ExponentialBuckets`); never default. Pick buckets that span the
  expected p50 to p99.9 range with at most 10-15 buckets total.

### Updating a Metric

Counters use `Inc` or `Add`. Gauges use `Set`. Histograms use `Observe`.
Always pass label values in the order they appear in the metric
declaration; Prometheus does not protect against argument-order swaps.

```go
telemetry.CleanupQueueEnqueuedTotal.WithLabelValues(reason).Inc()
telemetry.CleanupDLQDepth.Set(float64(depth))
telemetry.RequestDurationSeconds.WithLabelValues(operation, status).Observe(elapsed.Seconds())
```

### Tying Metrics, Tracing, and Audit Together

Every state-changing operation should produce all three signals at the
relevant scope:

| Signal | Where |
|---|---|
| Metric | At the layer where the count makes sense (manager for per-request counters, worker for per-tick counters) |
| Span | One per layer call (`Manager <Op>`, `Backend <Op>`, store engine) |
| Audit log | At the *outer* layer responsible for the operation, with the request id from `audit.RequestID(ctx)` |

Skipping one degrades observability: missing metric means dashboards
cannot alert; missing span means a slow request cannot be traced;
missing audit log means a customer dispute cannot be reconstructed.

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- Test files live alongside the code they test: `server_test.go`, `objects_test.go`
- Use table-driven tests for operations with multiple input/output combinations
- Use `go.uber.org/mock/mockgen` for generating mocks from interfaces. Add `//go:generate mockgen` directives and run `make generate`. Generated mocks live alongside the interface they mock.
- Legacy hand-written mocks exist in `internal/testutil/` and some packages; prefer generated mocks for new tests
- Test names follow `TestFunctionName_Scenario` convention

### Integration Tests

- Located in `internal/integration/`
- Gated behind the `integration` build tag
- Run in-process with real MinIO and PostgreSQL containers
- Cover end-to-end flows: CRUD, quota enforcement, multipart, replication, circuit breaker

### Benchmarks

- Benchmark files use the `_bench_test.go` suffix: `auth_bench_test.go`, `helpers_bench_test.go`
- Integration benchmarks live in `internal/integration/bench_test.go` (gated behind the `integration` build tag)
- Run benchmarks: `make bench`, `make bench-auth`, `make bench-crypto`, etc. Override duration with `BENCH_TIME=5s make bench`
- Use `b.Loop()` (Go 1.24+) for all benchmark loops - not `for i := 0; i < b.N; i++`
- Use `b.SetBytes()` for throughput benchmarks so Go reports MB/s
- Use `b.ResetTimer()` after setup/population steps
- Use `b.RunParallel` with `pb.Next()` for concurrent benchmarks (`b.Loop()` cannot replace `pb.Next()` inside `RunParallel` callbacks)
- Pre-compute keys and test data outside the measured loop - `fmt.Sprintf` inside a benchmark loop measures string formatting, not the code under test
- Benchmark names follow `BenchmarkFunctionName/variant` with sub-benchmarks for different input sizes

### Fuzz Tests

- Fuzz test files use the `_fuzz_test.go` suffix: `auth_fuzz_test.go`, `xml_fuzz_test.go`
- Run fuzz targets: `make fuzz` (default 30s per target). Override with `FUZZ_TIME=5m make fuzz` for deeper exploration
- CI runs a 10s smoke test per target to catch regressions
- Seed the corpus with valid inputs, edge cases, and adversarial inputs via `f.Add()`
- Fuzz callbacks must never panic - verify invariants with `t.Errorf` instead
- Match the production code path - use `xml.NewDecoder().Decode` not `xml.Unmarshal` when production uses streaming decoders
- **Differential oracles:** When two implementations exist for the same operation (e.g., `parseSigV4Fields` and `parseSigV4FieldsDirect`), fuzz both and assert they agree on every input
- **Structural invariants:** Assert properties of the output that must always hold (e.g., "canonical request has exactly N newlines", "bucket never contains a slash", "nonce is always 12 bytes")
- Do not assert application-level validation at the parsing layer - XML decoders accept negative integers; the handler layer validates range constraints

### Test Patterns

- **Generated mocks** (`mockgen`) are the preferred approach for new tests - they stay in sync with interfaces automatically
- **FailableStore** wraps a store to inject errors for circuit breaker testing
- Test assertions use standard `testing.T` methods, not external assertion libraries

### Coverage Exclusions

Go has no built-in coverage ignore directive. Use the Codecov `// codecov:ignore` inline comment to exclude untestable code (process entry points, `os.Exit` wrappers) from coverage reports. Always include a reason after the directive:

```go
func runValidate() { // codecov:ignore -- os.Exit wrapper, logic tested via validateConfig
    // ...
    os.Exit(1)
}
```

Use this sparingly and only for code that genuinely cannot be tested:
- `main()` and subcommand entry points that call `os.Exit`
- Signal handlers and process lifecycle glue

Do **not** use `codecov:ignore` for code that requires a database, S3 backend, or Redis - integration tests run with testcontainers and contribute coverage. Extract testable logic into separate functions that return errors instead of calling `os.Exit` directly.

## Code Style

### Character Rules

**ALWAYS USE:**
- ASCII dash: `-` (hyphen-minus, U+002D)
- Standard ASCII characters only

**NEVER USE:**
- Unicode em-dash (U+2014)
- Unicode en-dash (U+2013)
- Unicode box-drawing (U+2500)
- Equals signs for dividers

### Professional Tone

Avoid:
- Personal references: "Let me show you...", "We need to..."
- Numbered lists in comments: "1. First do this", "2. Then do that"
- Conversational tone: "Now we're going to..."
- Future tense: "This will create...", "We'll configure..."

Use:
- Present tense: "Creates", "Configures", "Manages"
- Declarative statements: "Service runs on port 9000"
- Technical precision: "Uses SigV4 for request authentication"
- Impersonal voice: "The manager selects...", "The circuit breaker wraps..."

---

## Versioning

The `.version` file in the repository root controls the version baked into binaries, Docker images, and Debian packages. Every PR that changes Go or SQL files must bump the version.

**Patch bump** (v0.X.Y -> v0.X.Y+1) for:
- Bug fixes
- Refactoring (no behavior change)
- Documentation updates
- Test improvements
- Dependency updates
- Cleanup and code style changes

**Minor bump** (v0.X.0 -> v0.X+1.0) for:
- New features (new config fields, new API endpoints, new CLI commands)
- Breaking changes (required config fields, changed defaults, removed options)
- Schema migrations that add tables or columns

---

## Documentation Updates

When a PR changes config fields, API behavior, or deployment requirements, update all affected documentation in the same PR:

- `packaging/config.yaml` - sample config
- `config.yaml` - local dev config
- `README.md` - config reference section
- `docs/*.md` - per-topic operational documentation (see `docs/admin-guide.md` for the index)
- `docs/security-hardening.md` - if security-relevant
- `docs/disaster-recovery.md` - if it affects failure modes
- `web/content/guides/*.md` - deployment guides
- `deploy/` - Nomad, Kubernetes, and Helm manifests

Search across all docs with `grep -rn 'field_name' README.md docs/ web/content/ packaging/ deploy/` before committing to catch every reference.

---

## Branch Naming

When a branch corresponds to a GitHub issue, use this format:

```
GH_ISSUE_<issue number>-<description of topic>
```

Examples:
- `GH_ISSUE_251-worker-pool-parallelism`
- `GH_ISSUE_42-multipart-upload-cleanup`

For branches without a linked issue, use a short kebab-case description of the topic.

## Examples

### Good

```go
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Replicator - Background Replica Creation Worker
//
// Author: Alex Freidah
//
// Creates additional copies of under-replicated objects across backends. Objects
// are written to one backend on PUT; this worker asynchronously ensures each
// object reaches the configured replication factor. Uses conditional DB inserts
// to safely handle concurrent overwrites and deletes.
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

package worker

// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
// PUBLIC API
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Replicate finds under-replicated objects and creates additional copies to
// reach the target replication factor. Returns the number of copies created.
func (r *Replicator) Replicate(ctx context.Context, cfg config.ReplicationConfig) (int, error) {
    start := time.Now()
    ctx = audit.WithRequestID(ctx, audit.NewID())

    // Find under-replicated objects
    locations, err := r.store.GetUnderReplicatedObjects(ctx, cfg.Factor, cfg.BatchSize)
    if err != nil {
        return 0, fmt.Errorf("failed to query under-replicated objects: %w", err)
    }
    // ...
}
```

### Bad

```go
// ==================================
// Replicator
//
// This module will handle replication for the user.
// Here's how it works:
// 1. First we find objects that need replication
// 2. Then we copy them to other backends
// 3. Finally we record the results
// ==================================

package worker

// Let's create the replicate function
func (r *Replicator) Replicate(ctx context.Context, cfg config.ReplicationConfig) (int, error) {
    // get the start time
    start := time.Now()
    // ...
}
```

**Remember:** Comments should explain *why* decisions were made, not *what* the code does. The code itself should be clear enough to understand *what* it does.
