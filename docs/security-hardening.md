This guide covers recommended security practices for production deployments of the S3 Orchestrator.

## TLS Configuration

### Basic TLS

Enable TLS by providing a certificate and private key:

```yaml
server:
  tls:
    cert_file: "/etc/s3-orchestrator/tls/server.crt"
    key_file: "/etc/s3-orchestrator/tls/server.key"
    min_version: "1.2"   # "1.2" (default) or "1.3"
```

- Use `min_version: "1.3"` for environments where all clients support TLS 1.3.
- Use `min_version: "1.2"` (default) for broader compatibility. TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are never supported.
- Certificates are reloaded automatically on `SIGHUP` without dropping connections.

### Certificate Renewal

The orchestrator watches for `SIGHUP` to reload certificates from disk. Integrate with your certificate manager:

```bash
# After certificate renewal (e.g., certbot, vault-cert-manager)
systemctl reload s3-orchestrator
```

## Mutual TLS (mTLS)

mTLS requires clients to present a certificate signed by a trusted CA. This restricts access to authorized clients only.

### Setup

1. **Generate a CA** (or use an existing one):

   ```bash
   openssl genrsa -out ca.key 4096
   openssl req -new -x509 -key ca.key -out ca.crt -days 3650 \
     -subj "/CN=S3 Orchestrator CA"
   ```

2. **Generate a client certificate**:

   ```bash
   openssl genrsa -out client.key 2048
   openssl req -new -key client.key -out client.csr \
     -subj "/CN=my-app"
   openssl x509 -req -in client.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key \
     -CAcreateserial -out client.crt -days 365
   ```

3. **Configure the orchestrator**:

   ```yaml
   server:
     tls:
       cert_file: "/etc/s3-orchestrator/tls/server.crt"
       key_file: "/etc/s3-orchestrator/tls/server.key"
       client_ca_file: "/etc/s3-orchestrator/tls/ca.crt"
   ```

4. **Test with curl**:

   ```bash
   curl --cert client.crt --key client.key \
     --cacert server-ca.crt \
     https://s3-orchestrator:9000/health
   ```

Clients without a valid certificate receive a TLS handshake error and cannot connect.

## Server-Side Encryption

When encryption is enabled, all objects are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before being stored on backends. Backends never see plaintext - they only store ciphertext. This protects against data exposure if a backend is compromised or if storage media is improperly decommissioned.

### Key Management

The master key wraps per-object DEKs using envelope encryption. Choose the key source based on your security requirements:

| Source | Security level | Use case |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| `master_key` (inline/env var) | Good | Dev, staging, simple deployments with env var injection |
| `master_key_file` | Better | Bare-metal with config management (Ansible, Puppet) provisioning the key file |
| Vault Transit | Best | Production with HSM-backed key management, audit logging, automatic key versioning |

**Recommendations:**

- **Never commit encryption keys** to version control. Use `${ENV_VAR}` expansion or `master_key_file`.
- **Restrict key file permissions:** `chmod 600 /path/to/keyfile && chown root:root /path/to/keyfile`
- **Rotate keys periodically** using the `rotate-encryption-key` admin API. See the [Admin Guide](operations.md#rotating-encryption-keys).
- **Keep previous keys** in the config until all DEKs have been re-wrapped. Removing an old key before rotation completes makes objects encrypted with that key unrecoverable.
- **Back up your encryption keys** separately from your data backups. Without the key, encrypted data is unrecoverable.

### Vault Transit Integration

For production deployments, Vault Transit provides the strongest key management:

```yaml
encryption:
  enabled: true
  vault:
    address: "https://vault.example.com:8200"
    token: "${VAULT_TOKEN}"
    key_name: "s3-orchestrator"
    mount_path: "transit"
```

- The orchestrator calls Vault to wrap/unwrap DEKs - the master key never leaves Vault.
- Vault provides audit logging of all key operations.
- Key rotation in Vault automatically versions the key; the orchestrator's `rotate-encryption-key` API re-wraps DEKs to the latest version.

When using `token_file` for Nomad workload identity, the file must have permissions `0600` or stricter. The orchestrator rejects token files that are group- or world-readable to prevent accidental exposure of the Vault token to other local users.

### Encryption Metrics

Monitor encryption health with these Prometheus metrics:

| Metric | What to watch |
|--------|---------------|
| `s3o_encryption_errors_total` | Any non-zero rate indicates encryption/decryption failures |
| `s3o_encrypt_existing_objects_total{status="error"}` | Failures during bulk encryption of existing data |
| `s3o_decrypt_existing_objects_total{status="error"}` | Failures during bulk decryption of existing data |
| `s3o_key_rotation_objects_total{status="error"}` | Failures during key rotation |
| `s3o_encryption_unknown_key_id_total` | Decryptions falling back to primary key due to unrecognized keyID |

### Nonce Safety

Chunked encryption derives per-chunk nonces by XORing the chunk index into a random base nonce. AES-GCM security requires that the same (key, nonce) pair is never reused. This is guaranteed because each object gets a fresh random DEK and a fresh random base nonce - even re-uploads of identical content produce different ciphertext. The `SAFETY INVARIANT` comment block at `internal/encryption/chunk.go:258-280` captures the three-clause reasoning (fresh DEK per object, fresh base nonce per call, sequential chunk indices) and notes when this derivation must be replaced (e.g., if the DEK-per-object invariant is ever relaxed for performance).

## SigV4 Path Handling

The SigV4 verifier canonicalises the request URI from the wire form
(`r.URL.RawPath`, with `r.URL.Path` as the fallback when the URL parser
preserved the wire form verbatim). Object keys whose URL-encoded shape
differs from their decoded form  -  most importantly keys containing
`%2F` (a literal `/` as part of the key, not a directory separator)  -
are addressable through the orchestrator and round-trip cleanly through
the AWS SDK signers.

The same wire-form canonicalisation closes a path-substitution risk: an
upstream proxy that normalises `/foo%2Fbar` to `/foo/bar` after the
client signed the request cannot have the substituted form silently
accepted, because the verifier's canonical request reflects what the
proxy actually delivered, not the decoded path.

## Multipart Upload Bucket Isolation

Multipart upload IDs are not secret capabilities. Every per-uploadId
request (`UploadPart`, `CompleteMultipartUpload`, `AbortMultipartUpload`,
`ListParts`) is scoped to the bucket and key on the request URL: the
manager fetches the upload's stored `ObjectKey` and rejects the call with
`404 NoSuchUpload` whenever the URL implies a different bucket/key pair.
A caller holding valid credentials for one bucket cannot manipulate
in-flight multipart uploads owned by another bucket, even if they obtain
the upload ID through logs, telemetry, or response leakage. The 404
response is intentionally identical to the response for a non-existent
upload so a caller cannot probe for upload IDs across buckets by
observing differing failure modes.

## Object Data Cache

When the in-memory object data cache is enabled (`cache.enabled: true`), cached objects are stored as post-decryption plaintext in process memory. This has the same security properties as any other in-process data - the plaintext exists in the orchestrator's address space for the duration of the cache entry's TTL, just as it does transiently during a normal GET response stream. The cache does not persist data to disk. Standard process isolation and memory protection apply; if an attacker can read the orchestrator's memory, they can already intercept plaintext during streaming regardless of caching.

## Data Integrity Verification

Integrity verification detects silent data corruption (bit rot, backend-side corruption, storage media degradation) by computing SHA-256 hashes at write time and verifying them on read and via background scrubbing.

### Enabling Integrity

```yaml
integrity:
  enabled: true
  verify_on_read: true
  verify_on_replicate: false
  scrubber_interval: "6h"
  scrubber_batch_size: 100
```

### How it protects your data

- **Write path:** SHA-256 is computed on plaintext before encryption and stored in the database.
- **Read path:** When `verify_on_read` is enabled, a `VerifyingReader` computes the hash as data streams to the client. On mismatch, the corrupted copy is automatically enqueued for cleanup. Range requests are not verified, since the stored hash covers the whole object and no slice of it can match; the scrubber covers those objects instead.
- **Replication:** When `verify_on_replicate` is enabled, each new copy is read back from its target and hash-checked before it is recorded. A copy that disagrees with its source is deleted and another target is tried, so a corrupt copy never counts toward the replication factor.
- **Background scrubber:** Works through the copies least recently verified, reads them from their backend, decrypts if needed, and checks the hash. A copy that fails is discarded, both its bytes and its ledger row, so the replicator re-creates it from a healthy copy when replication is configured.
- **Backfill:** Objects written before integrity was enabled can be brought under hash management via `admin backfill-checksums`.

### Recommendations

- **Enable `verify_on_read`** for production deployments. The overhead is minimal - SHA-256 is computed inline during streaming with no additional buffering.
- **Enable the scrubber** to catch corruption in objects that haven't been read recently. A 6-hour interval with 100 objects per batch provides steady coverage without excessive backend API usage.
- **Weigh `verify_on_replicate` against your egress bill.** Unlike the other checks it is not close to free: reading each new copy back doubles what a replica costs to create. It is worth it where a silently corrupt replica counting toward the replication factor is the risk you care about, and hard to justify where the scrubber already reaches every copy often enough.
- **Run backfill** after enabling integrity on an existing deployment. Unhashed objects are invisible to read-time verification, to replica verification, and to the scrubber.
- **Monitor integrity metrics** for any non-zero `s3o_integrity_errors_total` rate, which indicates data corruption.

### Integrity Metrics

| Metric | What to watch |
|--------|---------------|
| `s3o_integrity_checks_total{operation}` | Verification count by operation (read, replicate, scrub) |
| `s3o_integrity_errors_total{operation}` | Any non-zero rate indicates data corruption |
| `s3o_integrity_usage_declined_total` | Copies left unverified for lack of backend egress headroom |

## Configuration File Security

The config file contains sensitive credentials:

- Database password (`database.password`)
- Backend S3 credentials (`backends[].access_key_id`, `backends[].secret_access_key`)
- Root credential (`auth.root.access_key_id`, `auth.root.secret_access_key`)
- Dashboard session key (`ui.session_secret`)
- Client S3 credentials (`buckets[].credentials[]`)
- Encryption master key (`encryption.master_key`, `encryption.previous_keys[]`)
- Vault token (`encryption.vault.token`)

### Recommendations

**File permissions:**

```bash
chmod 600 /etc/s3-orchestrator/config.yaml
chown root:root /etc/s3-orchestrator/config.yaml
```

**Use environment variable expansion** to avoid storing secrets in the file:

```yaml
database:
  password: "${DB_PASSWORD}"

backends:
  - access_key_id: "${OCI_ACCESS_KEY}"
    secret_access_key: "${OCI_SECRET_KEY}"
```

Provide the environment variables via systemd `EnvironmentFile`, Vault agent injection, Nomad template blocks, or Kubernetes secrets.

**Never commit config files** with real credentials to version control. The `.gitignore` already excludes `/config.yaml` at the project root.

## Network Segmentation

- **PostgreSQL** should only be reachable from orchestrator instances. It does not need public access.
- **Storage backends** (if self-hosted like MinIO) should only be reachable from orchestrator instances.
- **The orchestrator** is the only component that needs to be exposed to clients.
- **Admin API** (`/admin/api/`) is protected by token auth and per-IP rate limiting (when enabled). Consider additionally restricting access at the network level (firewall rules or reverse proxy ACLs) for defense in depth.
- **Metrics endpoint** (`/metrics`) exposes backend names, quota utilization, replication factor, and circuit breaker state. Bind it to an internal-only address to prevent public access:

  ```yaml
  telemetry:
    metrics:
      enabled: true
      listen: "127.0.0.1:9091"  # only reachable from localhost / internal network
      pprof: false              # opt-in; see "Pprof endpoints" below
  ```

  When `listen` is set, `/metrics` is not served on the main S3 port. Prometheus scrapes from the internal address instead.

- **Pprof endpoints** (`/debug/pprof/*`) expose deep runtime state - stack frames, command-line flags, on-demand CPU profiles that double as DoS amplifiers (`/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=300`). They are **off by default** and only mounted when both `telemetry.metrics.listen` is set AND `telemetry.metrics.pprof: true`. Inline-metrics deployments (no dedicated listener) never get pprof regardless of the flag. Enable temporarily for profiling investigations only, and keep the metrics listener bound to an internal-only interface. `/debug/pprof/goroutineleak` belongs in the amplifier category too: serving it runs repeated stop-the-world leak-detection garbage collections until they converge. See [Monitoring](monitoring.md#goroutine-leak-profile).

### Kubernetes Hardening

The provided Kubernetes manifests include several security measures:

- **seccompProfile: RuntimeDefault** - applies the default seccomp profile to restrict syscalls
- **automountServiceAccountToken: false** - the orchestrator does not need Kubernetes API access
- **NetworkPolicy** - restricts ingress to port 9000 (and the metrics port when `metrics.dedicatedListener.enabled` is set, scoped to the configured `scraperSelector`); egress is permissive since backend endpoints are config-driven
- **Dedicated metrics Service** - when `metrics.dedicatedListener.enabled: true`, the chart renders a separate `*-metrics` ClusterIP Service that is forced to `ClusterIP` regardless of the public Service type. This prevents the metrics surface (and any opted-in pprof) from accidentally being exposed externally if the public Service is upgraded to LoadBalancer/NodePort.
- **readOnlyRootFilesystem**, **runAsNonRoot**, **capabilities.drop: ALL** - standard container hardening (see `deploy/helm/s3-orchestrator/templates/deployment.yaml`)

```
Internet --> Reverse Proxy --> S3 Orchestrator --> PostgreSQL (private)
                                              --> Backends (private)
```

## Audit Logging

The orchestrator emits structured audit log entries with `"audit":true` for security-relevant operations:

- Every S3 request (GET, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
- Storage-level operations (backend reads, writes, deletes)
- Background operations (rebalance, replication, cleanup)

### Attributing an action to a caller

Every entry from an authenticated request carries `user`, naming the identity behind the credential that proved it. This is what answers "which service deleted this object" when several share a bucket with independent keys, an arrangement [Authentication](authentication.md#several-credentials-on-one-bucket) recommends.

The identity is recorded rather than the access key deliberately: a keypair rotates under one identity, so recording the key would break the trail at every rotation and leave two halves nothing joins. Secrets never appear in a log line at all.

An entry with no `user` authenticated no caller. A request rejected before authentication succeeds is one; a background worker acting on its own schedule is the other.

```
# Everything one identity did
jq 'select(.audit == true and .user == "user-abc123")'

# Who deleted objects from a bucket
jq 'select(.audit == true and .event == "s3.DeleteObject" and .bucket == "app2-files") | {time, user, key}'
```

### Request ID Correlation

Each request gets a unique ID that flows through all log entries:

- Clients can send `X-Request-Id` header (honored if present)
- Otherwise, a 16-byte hex ID is generated automatically
- Returned as `X-Amz-Request-Id` in the response
- Propagated to storage operations for end-to-end tracing

### Monitoring Patterns

Filter audit events in your log aggregator:

```
# All audit events
jq 'select(.audit == true)'

# All write operations
jq 'select(.audit == true and .event == "s3.PutObject")'

# Events for a specific request
jq 'select(.request_id == "abc123...")'
```

The `s3o_audit_events_total` Prometheus counter with `event` label tracks audit event volume for alerting.

## Admission Control

Limit the number of concurrent S3 requests to prevent backend and database saturation under load:

```yaml
server:
  max_concurrent_requests: 30    # 0 = unlimited (default)
  # max_concurrent_reads: 20     # separate read limit (optional)
  # max_concurrent_writes: 10    # separate write limit (optional)
  # load_shed_threshold: 0.8     # probabilistic shedding at 80% capacity (optional)
  # admission_wait: "50ms"       # brief wait before rejection (optional)
```

When the limit is reached, new requests receive `503 SlowDown` with a `Retry-After: 1` header. Split read/write pools prevent write storms from starving reads. Active load shedding provides smooth degradation before the hard limit. A good starting point for the global limit is 2-3x your `database.max_conns` value. See [Performance Tuning](performance-tuning.md#admission-control) for detailed guidance.

### Request header limits

Admission control bounds how many requests run at once; these bound how much a single request can cost before it gets that far:

```yaml
server:
  max_header_bytes: 65536        # total header size (default: 1 MiB)
  max_header_value_count: 100    # header values per request (default: 500)
```

Both default to the `net/http` values, which are generous - an S3 client sends on the order of 20 headers, not 500. Tightening them costs nothing in compatibility and rejects oversized header sets during parsing, before routing, authentication, or any database work. Neither is reloadable; they are applied to the listener at startup.

## Rate Limiting

Protect against abuse and accidental overload:

```yaml
rate_limit:
  enabled: true
  requests_per_sec: 100   # token refill rate
  burst: 200              # max burst size
  cleanup_interval: "1m"  # eviction sweep interval (default: 1m)
  cleanup_max_age: "5m"   # evict entries not seen within this window (default: 5m)
```

A background goroutine evicts per-IP entries not seen within `cleanup_max_age` every `cleanup_interval`. Under sustained attack with high source-IP cardinality, the map can hold up to `cleanup_max_age` worth of unique IPs. Lower both values for tighter memory bounds.

### Behind a Reverse Proxy

When the orchestrator sits behind a load balancer, configure trusted proxies so rate limiting uses the real client IP from `X-Forwarded-For`:

```yaml
rate_limit:
  enabled: true
  requests_per_sec: 100
  burst: 200
  trusted_proxies:
    - "10.0.0.0/8"
    - "172.16.0.0/12"
```

Without this, all requests appear to come from the proxy IP and share a single rate limit bucket.

The login throttle (brute-force protection on the dashboard login) also uses the same `trusted_proxies` configuration and IP extraction logic, so it correctly identifies real client IPs behind a reverse proxy.

## Browser Access (CORS)

CORS rules are declared per bucket (see [Configuration](configuration.md#browser-access-cors)) and default to empty, which refuses every cross-origin preflight. A bucket reached only by server-side clients should be left that way: a request with no `Origin` header is not cross-origin and is never affected by these rules.

What a rule does and does not grant:

- **A preflight is answered before authentication.** It has to be - a browser cannot sign one. The preflight grants no access on its own; it reports whether the request the browser intends to send is one the operator permits, and that request authenticates with SigV4 or a presigned signature exactly as any other does. A CORS rule is not a credential and never substitutes for one.
- **A refused preflight reveals nothing.** The response is identical whether the bucket has no rules, has rules that do not admit the request, or does not exist at all, so the one endpoint reachable without a credential cannot be used to enumerate buckets.
- **Preflights are rate-limited and admission-controlled.** The CORS middleware sits inside both, so an unsigned preflight is bounded by the same protections as any other request on the surface.
- **`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` is not supported.** Authentication travels in headers or a presigned query string, never in cookies, so credentialed mode adds nothing and would forbid wildcard origins.

Scope each rule as narrowly as the application allows. `allowed_origins: ["*"]` lets any site on the internet make a browser read a response from the bucket, which is only appropriate for content that is genuinely public. Prefer naming the origins, and note that a wildcard entry like `https://*.example.com` matches any subdomain - including one an attacker controls if subdomain takeover is possible.

Watch `s3o_cors_preflight_total{result="rejected"}`: a sustained climb from an origin you did not configure is either a misconfigured deployment of your own application or somebody probing the surface from a browser.

## Request Body Limits

All admin and UI JSON endpoints enforce a 1 MB request body limit via `http.MaxBytesReader`. This prevents memory exhaustion from oversized payloads. File uploads use the configured `max_object_size` limit instead. These limits are built-in and not user-configurable.

## Streaming SigV4 Payloads

The orchestrator accepts the three AWS streaming-payload modes clients
use when `Content-Encoding: aws-chunked` is set:

| `X-Amz-Content-Sha256` value                  | Variant                  | Chunks signed | Trailer signed |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|----------------|
| `STREAMING-AWS4-HMAC-SHA256-PAYLOAD`          | signed                   | yes           | n/a            |
| `STREAMING-AWS4-HMAC-SHA256-PAYLOAD-TRAILER`  | signed + trailer         | yes           | yes            |
| `STREAMING-UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD-TRAILER`          | unsigned chunks + trailer| no            | yes            |

The seed signature in the `Authorization` header authenticates the
request envelope; the body is authenticated separately by the chained
per-chunk signatures (or by the trailer signature for the unsigned-
trailer variant). The orchestrator verifies the chain in-stream and
strips the chunk framing before any byte reaches storage.

Failure modes and their responses:

- **Chunk-signature or trailer-signature mismatch** -- `403 SignatureDoesNotMatch`.
- **Malformed framing** (bare LF, missing CRLF, malformed hex chunk size,
  missing `chunk-signature=` extension on a signed variant, missing
  `x-amz-trailer-signature` on a trailer variant) -- `400 InvalidRequest`.
- **Body length disagrees with `x-amz-decoded-content-length`** --
  `400 IncompleteBody`.

Wire-level limits:

- Maximum declared chunk size: 16 MiB.
- Maximum chunk-header line length: 1 KiB.
- Maximum trailer block: 8 KiB across at most 16 trailer headers.
- One chunk is buffered in memory at a time; the streaming property of
  the original PUT is preserved.

Two metrics report streaming traffic and rejection reasons:

- `s3o_auth_streaming_requests_total{variant}` -- streaming requests
  received, labelled by variant (`signed`, `signed_trailer`,
  `unsigned_trailer`).
- `s3o_auth_streaming_rejections_total{reason}` -- requests rejected
  mid-stream, labelled by `chunk_signature_mismatch`,
  `trailer_signature_mismatch`, `chunk_malformed`, `chunk_too_large`,
  `decoded_length_mismatch`, or `trailer_malformed`.

Operators behind a TLS-terminating proxy do not need to configure
anything for streaming SigV4 to work; the orchestrator detects the
mode from the request headers and validates the chain using the same
signing key derived from the seed signature.

## Web UI Authentication

### Separating administrative credentials

The dashboard, the admin API and the S3 API all authenticate the same credential type, so separating administrative access is a matter of issuing separate credentials rather than of configuring separate mechanisms. Declare `auth.root` for break-glass, then issue each operator a credential of their own and grant it only the control-plane permissions their job needs:

```bash
# A monitoring credential that can read the control plane and nothing else.
s3-orchestrator admin user create -name monitoring
s3-orchestrator admin credential issue -user user-mon -label "prometheus sidecar"
s3-orchestrator admin grant add -user user-mon -kind orchestrator -permissions admin-read
```

Each credential is revoked on its own, and an audit entry names the user behind the action rather than a key several people share. `admin-provision` is worth withholding in particular: a grant carrying it can mint a grant carrying anything.

The admin API returns operational metadata only. Object and backend responses never include secret material - the object-locations endpoint reports whether a copy is encrypted and the wrapping `key_id`, but never the wrapped or raw data-encryption key.

### Secure Cookies Behind TLS Proxies

When the orchestrator sits behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy (Traefik, nginx, ALB), the connection to the orchestrator itself is plaintext HTTP. The session and CSRF cookies still need the `Secure` flag so browsers only send them over HTTPS. There are two ways to get the `Secure` flag set in this layout.

**Recommended: trust the proxy and honour `X-Forwarded-Proto`.** Configure `rate_limit.trusted_proxies` with the CIDR(s) the proxy connects from, and ensure the proxy forwards `X-Forwarded-Proto: https`. The orchestrator sets `Secure` on every cookie when the direct peer is in the trusted CIDR set and the header reads `https`. The check is spoof-resistant - requests from outside the trusted CIDR cannot claim TLS by setting the header themselves.

```yaml
rate_limit:
  trusted_proxies:
    - "10.0.0.0/8"     # the network the reverse proxy connects from
    - "172.16.0.0/12"
```

Most reverse proxies forward `X-Forwarded-Proto` automatically, but the option may be named differently or off by default depending on the implementation - consult the proxy's documentation.

**Alternative: force the flag unconditionally.** When the proxy is not under your control, or you'd rather not depend on the header path, set `force_secure_cookies: true`. Cookies then ship with `Secure=true` regardless of the request's apparent scheme.

```yaml
ui:
  force_secure_cookies: true
```

`force_secure_cookies` overrides the trusted-proxy detection: when it is true the header check is not consulted.

### CSRF Protection

State-changing UI API requests (POST to `/ui/api/*`) require a `X-CSRF-Token` header matching the `s3orch_csrf` cookie. This double-submit cookie pattern prevents cross-site request forgery attacks from same-site subdomains. The dashboard JavaScript handles this automatically. GET requests and non-UI endpoints (S3 API, admin API) are unaffected.

### Keeping the root secret off disk

The root secret is a signing key, so it has to be readable in full - there is no hashed form that would still verify a signature. Keep it out of the config file itself: every value supports `${ENV_VAR}` expansion, so a Vault template, a Nomad template or a Kubernetes secret can supply it without the secret ever touching disk.

```yaml
auth:
  root:
    access_key_id: "${ROOT_ACCESS_KEY_ID}"
    secret_access_key: "${ROOT_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}"
```

For a bare-metal or `.deb` installation where the file is at rest on disk, restrict it to the service account (`chmod 600`) and treat it like any other credential file. A deployment that would rather hold no administering secret at all can leave `auth.root` out entirely and administer itself through credentials the store holds, provided the dashboard is disabled.

### Session Portability

Session keys are derived deterministically from the config (via HMAC-SHA256), so sessions survive restarts and are portable across instances sharing the same config. No session storage or shared state is required beyond the config file itself.

For multi-instance deployments behind a load balancer, ensure all instances use the same `session_secret`. A session created on one instance will be accepted by any other instance with a matching value. `session_secret` is independent of every credential - rotating one does not affect the other.

## Credential Rotation

Stored credentials rotate through the provisioning API with no restart and no reload: issue a replacement keypair for the user, move the client onto it, then revoke the old one. Several keypairs may name one user, which is what makes the overlap possible. See the [admin guide](operations.md#rotating-client-credentials) for the procedure.

Config-declared client credentials rotate through the SIGHUP reload mechanism instead, since the config file is their source of truth.

The root credential rotates on `SIGHUP` like any config-declared credential: the registry is rebuilt from the file merged with the store, so the new keypair takes effect on the next request and the old one stops working at the same moment.

## Presigned URL Security

Presigned URLs embed SigV4 authentication in query parameters, allowing time-limited access to objects without requiring the requester to hold credentials.

**Recommendations:**

- **Use TLS in production.** Presigned URLs expose the signature in the URL itself. Without TLS, a network observer can capture and reuse the URL until it expires.
- **Use short expiry values.** 5-15 minutes is sufficient for most use cases (e.g., generating a download link for an authenticated user). Reserve longer expiry times for workflows that genuinely need them.
- **Maximum expiry is enforced server-side.** The orchestrator rejects presigned URLs with an expiry longer than 7 days (604800 seconds), matching the AWS S3 limit.
- **No additional configuration required.** Presigned URLs use the same `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` already configured on the bucket. There are no separate presigned URL settings to manage.
