The admin API is the operational control plane for a running instance: backend health, worker state, replication and cleanup queues, integrity passes, cache control, and destructive backend removal.

The reference below is generated from the server's route table, so it always matches the code that serves it. Everything the endpoints exchange is described there; this page covers the parts a schema cannot express.

## Authentication

The admin API takes the same credential the S3 API does: an access key and secret, SigV4-signed. Use `s3-orchestrator admin`, which signs for you:

```bash
s3-orchestrator admin -access-key AKIA... -secret-key ... status
```

The keypair also reads from `$S3O_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `$S3O_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. Hand-signing SigV4 in a shell is not worth doing, which is why the examples on this page use `adminctl` rather than `curl`.

Declare the credential that administers a deployment under `auth.root`:

```yaml
auth:
  root:
    access_key_id: "AKIAROOT..."
    secret_access_key: "..."
```

That is an ordinary identity holding every permission on every resource, not a special case in the request path. Issue narrower credentials through the provisioning API and grant them what they need.

Requests without a valid signature get `401` with a JSON body. Request bodies are capped at 1 MB.

## Authorization

The endpoints under `/admin/api/objects` read and write object data, reaching the same service the S3 API does. They are authorized against the permissions the caller's grant carries, not against having authenticated: browsing needs `list`, downloading needs `read`, uploading needs `write`, removing a key or a prefix needs `delete`, and changing an object's tags needs `tags`. Reading a tag set needs only `read`, the same as reading the object it describes. A caller whose grant does not carry what the operation needs gets `403`.

A provisioned credential reaches those endpoints with exactly the grants it holds:

```bash
s3-orchestrator admin -access-key AKIA... -secret-key ... \
  object-locations -key photos/holiday.jpg
```

A prefix naming no single bucket -- the empty prefix, or a partial name like `pho` -- cannot be authorized against one grant and is refused.

### The control plane

Every other endpoint declares a permission over a **backend** or over the **instance**, and a caller reaches it by holding a grant on that resource carrying that permission. A credential holding only bucket grants is refused on all of them.

| Permission | What it reaches |
| --- | --- |
| `admin-read` | Status, workers, reload outcome, replication and over-replication counts, cleanup depths, cache utilization, the current log level, drain progress |
| `admin-logs` | The in-memory log buffer and flight-recorder trace snapshots |
| `admin-maintain` | `replicate`, `rebalance`, `lifecycle`, `scrub`, `reconcile`, `backfill-checksums`, over-replication cleanup, usage flush and reconcile, cleanup DLQ requeue |
| `admin-convert` | `encrypt-existing`, `decrypt-existing`, `compress-existing`, `decompress-existing` |
| `admin-keys` | Encryption key rotation |
| `admin-cache` | Cache flush and per-key or per-prefix invalidation |
| `admin-drain` | Starting and cancelling a backend drain |
| `admin-decommission` | Removing a backend, with or without a purge |
| `admin-config` | Setting the runtime log level |
| `admin-provision` | Reading and writing buckets, users, credentials and grants |

The permissions over a backend are the ones that name one: drain, decommission, and the maintenance and conversion passes. A pass naming no backend runs against every one, so it is authorized as `backend:*` -- an operator granted one provider cannot start a conversion that spends egress on the rest of the fleet. Grant `backend:*` to an operator who runs fleet-wide passes.

`admin-provision` is deliberately its own permission rather than part of `admin-config`: a grant carrying it can mint a grant carrying anything.

## Streaming progress

Twelve endpoints run long enough that a single response is unhelpful: `rebalance`, `replicate`, `over-replication`, `scrub`, `backfill-checksums`, `reconcile`, `lifecycle`, `compress-existing`, `decompress-existing`, `encrypt-existing`, `decrypt-existing`, and a backend purge. They return their JSON result by default, but stream newline-delimited progress when the caller sends `Accept: application/x-ndjson`:

```bash
s3-orchestrator admin scrub
```

Each line is one self-contained JSON object with an `event` field: `start` when the operation begins, `step_start` and `step_end` per item, and a final `result` carrying the outcome. The `s3-orchestrator admin` subcommand asks for the stream and renders it as live progress.

## Restricting a pass to one backend

Six of the maintenance passes -- `scrub`, `backfill-checksums`, `encrypt-existing`, `decrypt-existing`, `compress-existing` and `decompress-existing` -- accept a `backend` parameter naming the one backend whose copies they read:

```bash
s3-orchestrator admin compress-existing -backend wasabi-eu
```

Omitting it runs the pass against every backend, which is what these did before the parameter existed. `reconcile` and the cleanup DLQ endpoints already took the same parameter and are unchanged.

Three reasons to reach for it. A re-encode or re-encrypt pass rewrites every object the deployment holds, and scoping it is how an operator tries one provider before committing the fleet. The `delay_ms` pacing on `backfill-checksums` applies to the whole pass rather than the backend it is reading from, so a run sized for the most expensive provider throttles the rest. And a backend restored from a failure needs only its own copies hashed or re-encrypted.

The filter is applied when candidates are selected, not after, so `max` is spent on copies the pass will act on rather than on rows it would discard. A name this instance does not serve is refused with `400`: a filter matching nothing is indistinguishable from a fleet with no work left, so a typo would otherwise report a clean pass over a backend that was never read.

## When a conversion meets a live write

The four conversions -- `encrypt-existing`, `decrypt-existing`, `compress-existing` and `decompress-existing` -- read a stored copy, transform it, and write it back. A client writing the same key in between is a race the pass is expected to lose sometimes, and the result carries a `changed` count for the copies it lost.

A conversion commits only while the copy still reports the ETag it read. When a client has replaced the object, no row matches and nothing is recorded, so the ledger never ends up describing bytes a newer write already replaced. Those copies are reported as `changed` rather than `failed`: nothing is misconfigured, and the newer write has already stored the object in whatever form the write path was set to use.

A non-zero `changed` count is worth acting on. The transformed bytes reached the backend before the commit refused, so each one names a copy whose stored bytes are the pass's output written over a newer client write -- the object reverted. Each is recorded as a `storage.ConversionRaced` audit event naming the key, the backend and the ETag the pass expected, and counted by `s3o_bulk_rewrite_copy_changed_total`. If you see them, run the conversion against a quieter window.

## Verifying one object

`POST /admin/api/object-scrub?key=...` reads every recorded copy of one key and compares it against the stored content hash, without waiting for the scrub queue to reach it. The response reports one verdict per copy -- `verified`, `mismatch`, `unreadable`, or `not_hashed` -- so a replicated object with one good copy and one bad one names the backend at fault.

A `mismatch` is acted on, not just reported: the bad copy is discarded and replication rebuilds it from a good one. The endpoint returns `404` when no copies of the key are recorded and `409` when integrity verification is disabled.

## Reading and writing objects

`/admin/api/objects` covers the object namespace itself: `GET` browses a page of it or streams one object down, `PUT` stores one, `DELETE` removes a key or a whole prefix. These exist so an operator on a terminal can inspect and repair data without a browser session or a second S3 client, and they are what the [TUI object browser](cli.md#tui) and the dashboard drive.

Every key must name a configured virtual bucket, the same requirement the dashboard enforces, so a typo cannot write outside the namespace the orchestrator serves. Uploads are capped at 512 MiB; a larger one is refused before it reaches a backend.

`GET /admin/api/objects` browses hierarchically by default: omit `delimiter` and keys are grouped into directories, which is what a file browser wants. Send `delimiter=` explicitly - present but empty - and the listing is flat, every key under the prefix in one stream. That is what a caller counting or sweeping a subtree needs, and it is how the TUI knows how many objects a prefix delete is about to remove before it asks.

Deletes report how many objects they removed in a `{"deleted":48}` body, so a caller can tell a no-op from a mass removal.

A prefix delete that removes some objects and fails on others answers `500` carrying the counts it did achieve (`deleted`, `failed`, `total`), because the prefix is left half removed and the caller needs to know that rather than to retry blind.

## Object tags

`/admin/api/objects/tags/{key}` reads, replaces and clears one object's tag set. It exchanges JSON rather than the `Tagging` XML the S3 endpoints use, because its callers are `adminctl`, the dashboard and the TUI:

```bash
# Read the set.
s3-orchestrator admin object-tags -key photos/report.pdf
# {"tags":[{"key":"team","value":"infra"}]}
```

`PUT` replaces the whole set rather than merging into it, matching `PutObjectTagging`. An empty list leaves the object untagged, which is the same outcome as `DELETE`. An untagged object reads back as `{"tags":[]}` rather than `null`.

A key holding no copies is refused with `404`: tags belong to an object, so there is nothing to attach them to. Exceeding a tag limit answers `400` with a message naming the measurement that broke it. Request bodies are capped at 64 KiB, far above the few kilobytes ten maximum-length tags occupy.

These endpoints reach the same stored set as the S3 `?tagging` operations, under the same per-key lock. See [Object Tagging](tagging.md) for the semantics and the limits.

## Removing a backend

`DELETE /admin/api/backends/{name}` is the one destructive endpoint, and the only one whose response shape depends on how it is called.

Without `purge=true` it drops the backend's database records and returns immediately. The objects stay on the backend's storage, so the removal is reversible by re-adding the backend and reconciling.

With `purge=true` it deletes the objects too, behind a two-phase confirmation:

```bash
# Phase 1: preview. Returns what would be destroyed, plus a token.
s3-orchestrator admin remove-backend oci --purge

# Phase 2: replay the token to execute. The token expires after 60 seconds.
s3-orchestrator admin remove-backend oci --purge --confirm
```

The confirmation token is signed and scoped to the backend it was issued for; it cannot be reused for a different one. It is also signed with a key minted per process, so a token does not survive a restart of the instance that issued it.

## Provisioning buckets and credentials

A deployment declares virtual buckets and the credentials that reach them in two
places: the config file, and the store. `GET /admin/api/provisioning` returns
both at once - every bucket, every user with the buckets it reaches, and every
credential - each entry carrying a `source` of `config` or `store`.

`source` is what tells you whether an entry can be changed. Config-declared
entries are visible and read-only: the API answers `403` to any attempt to
modify one, because an operator reading the config file has to be able to trust
what it says. Change those by editing the file and sending `SIGHUP`.

Onboarding a client is three calls: create a user, mint a keypair for it, grant
it a bucket.

```bash
# 1. Create the identity. The response carries the generated user_id.
s3-orchestrator admin user create -name nightly-backup

# 2. Mint a keypair for it. This response is the only place the secret appears.
s3-orchestrator admin credential issue -user user-abc123 -label "backup job"

# 3. Grant it a bucket, from either source.
s3-orchestrator admin grant add -user user-abc123 -name backups
```

The secret is returned once, by the request that minted it, and is never read
back into any listing. A caller that loses it mints a replacement and revokes
the old one; several keypairs may name one user, which is what lets one be
rotated while the rest keep working.

A caller whose secrets are generated somewhere else supplies the keypair
instead, by sending `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` on the create
request. Both are required together and one alone is refused; the response
echoes what was recorded either way, so both paths have the same shape.

Supplying is what makes the call converge. A caller rebuilding lost state
re-registers the keypair its secret store holds rather than minting a second one
it then has to distribute. An access key another credential already claims,
whether the config file or the store declares it, is refused with `409`.

`PUT /admin/api/provisioning/grants/{id}/{name}` declares exactly what a user
reaches on one resource, writing the grant when it is absent and replacing its
permissions when it is not. It takes the same `kind` query parameter the delete
route does. Being an upsert is what lets a caller state access without first
asking whether it is already there, and replacing in place is what keeps a
narrowing from leaving a window where the client reaches nothing.

`PATCH /admin/api/provisioning/users/{id}` changes the name an identity is read
by. The ID does not move, because credentials and grants reference it. This is
the only way to correct a name: a delete is refused while the user holds either.

Every change takes effect on the next request. The registry the request path
authenticates against is rebuilt before the call returns, so a credential
created here works immediately and one revoked here stops working immediately.

Removal is refused while something still depends on what is being removed: a
bucket that holds objects or is granted to a user, and a user that holds
credentials or grants, all answer `409` naming what is in the way. Emptying a
bucket and revoking a credential stay deliberate acts.

## Objects the orchestrator does not own

A backend's bucket can hold objects the orchestrator never wrote: data that predates it, or files placed there by something else. Reconcile records them at the key the backend holds them under and marks them **unmanaged**.

An unmanaged object counts toward the backend's `bytes_used`, because the bytes really are occupying the quota and placement decisions read those totals. Nothing else touches it: replication will not copy it, rebalance will not move it, drain will not relocate it, and scrub and checksum backfill skip it rather than spending egress reading a body the orchestrator does not manage. It is also unreachable through the S3 API, since no virtual bucket claims its key.

To bring such an object under management, move it under a virtual bucket's prefix on the backend; the next reconcile will pick it up as a normal object.

## Skipped operations

Endpoints that trigger a worker report whether the pass actually ran. A response with `"status": "ok"` did the work; `"status": "skipped"` did not, and carries a `reason` explaining why.

An operator who asks for a pass gets one. A worker that was never given a schedule still runs on demand: the endpoint falls back to the running configuration, then to defaults, rather than declining because nothing was configured. What remains skipped is work that would be meaningless: replication endpoints skip at factor 1, integrity endpoints skip when verification is disabled, encryption endpoints skip when no encryptor is configured, and rebalance skips when utilization is already within the threshold or the strategy plans no moves.

The compression endpoints skip only when no codec is available, which is not the same as compression being disabled. A codec is built either way so already-stored objects stay readable, so `compress-existing` is a legitimate thing to run on a fleet that has not turned compression on for writes yet.

This is not an error, so the status code is still `200`. Check `status` rather than the HTTP code when driving these from a script.

## Deliberate rejections

Three endpoints reject an input that would otherwise be a plausible convenience:

- `DELETE /admin/api/cache/prefix` requires a non-empty `prefix`. An empty one would drop every entry, and a full flush should be a deliberate call to `POST /admin/api/cache/flush` rather than an accidentally-empty parameter.
- `DELETE /admin/api/objects` requires a non-empty `prefix`. An empty one reads as "every object", which no request should be able to mean by omission.
- `POST /admin/api/rotate-encryption-key` requires `old_key_id`. Rotating "whatever is current" is ambiguous during a partial rotation.
