// Auth - The Identity Behind a Credential
//
// Author: Alex Freidah
//
// The identity a request authenticates as. A credential proves a caller is one
// user, and the user's bucket set says which buckets that one reaches.
// Credentials the config file declares and credentials the store holds both
// resolve to this shape, so the request path has one answer to give whichever
// source declared them.

//
// ID survives a rename and is what an audit record names, so neither rotating a
// credential nor renaming a user breaks the trail. FromConfig marks a user the
// config file declares, which the provisioning API refuses to modify.
//
// No secret lives here: a user may hold several keypairs, and the secret belongs
// to the one that proved the request.
