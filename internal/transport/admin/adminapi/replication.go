// copied up to factor) and over-replicated objects (waiting for cleanup), and
// when the snapshot was computed. Factor <= 1 means replication is disabled.

// way: the terminal status, and why the pass did nothing when it was skipped.

// the pass could not bring up to it. Failed is omitted when the pass left
