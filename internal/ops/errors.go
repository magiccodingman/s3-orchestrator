// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Ops - Skip and Rejection Errors
//
// Author: Alex Freidah
//
// An operation declines work for reasons that are not failures: a subsystem is
// turned off in config, or a worker planned no work for this pass. Both are
// reported as a SkipError so each transport can word the outcome for its own
// audience without the operations layer knowing what a wire status is.

// match it with errors.As and render Reason in whatever shape their protocol

// ErrCompressionUnavailable reports no codec, which is a different state from
// compression being disabled for writes: a codec is built either way so stored
// objects stay readable, and only its absence stops a rewrite.
