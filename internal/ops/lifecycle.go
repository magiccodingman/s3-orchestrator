// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Ops - Lifecycle Expiration Operation
//
// Author: Alex Freidah
//
// One on-demand expiration sweep, so an operator who has just written or
// corrected a lifecycle rule can find out whether it matches anything without
// waiting out the tick. That wait is an hour plus startup jitter, and until it
// passes a rule that matches nothing looks exactly like a rule that ran and
// found nothing expired.
