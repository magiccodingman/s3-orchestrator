// Compressed and LogicalSize are only consulted for bytes that are not an
// envelope. Compression runs before encryption, so an encrypted object's
// encoding is inside the ciphertext and invisible from here; that case is
// covered by adopting a sibling's description instead.

// CLASSIFICATION
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------

// ClassifyImport decides how to record bytes discovered on a backend, given
// what could be learned from the bytes and the rows the ledger already holds
// for that key on other backends.
//
// Adoption is deliberately not granted on a key-name match alone. Every PUT
// mints a fresh DEK, so a stray copy of a key is usually an earlier write
// whose key died with its row; handing it a sibling's key would produce a row
// that claims to be readable and is not. The header's base nonce is what
// distinguishes the two, since it is unique per encryption run and copies
// reproduce it byte for byte. A sibling that matches describes the same stored
// bytes in every respect, so its whole description is adopted rather than its
// key alone.
//
// A nil return means record no representation metadata at all.

			// need it. Only a rewrite pass reads that column, and it can treat
