// Provisioning - Grant Permissions
//
// Author: Alex Freidah
//
// The access a grant carries, as a bit per permission. A request is authorized
// by testing the permissions its operation needs against the set the caller's
// grant holds, which is one comparison however many bits either side names.
//
// The set is deliberately intent-shaped rather than one bit per S3 call: the
// same intents an operator recognises from IAM and from Azure's blob actions,
// so a grant written here means what it looks like it means on either. A
// permission added later takes the next power of two and nothing renumbers.
//
// The stored and rendered form is a comma-separated list rather than the
// integer, so a grant row read in psql or returned by the API says what it
// allows. Conversion happens where a row is mapped, and nothing above the store
// sees the text.

// PermissionSet is the access a grant carries. Bits are combined with OR when
// the set is built and tested with AND when a request is authorized.
//
// Sixty-four bits for sixteen permissions is headroom: a new one takes the next
// bit and nothing renumbers.
type PermissionSet uint64

// The permissions a grant may carry, one per operator-facing intent.
//
// ListBuckets and List are separate because they answer different questions: a
// client may be entitled to know a bucket exists without being entitled to
// enumerate what is in it, which is the same split AWS draws between
// s3:ListAllMyBuckets and s3:ListBucket.
//
// Read is the object and what describes it, tags included: a caller entitled to
// the bytes learns nothing further from the labels on them, and an SDK reading
// an object fetches both. Tags is the right to change them.

// The permissions a grant on a backend or on the orchestrator may carry. They
// share the bit space so a stored row says what it allows without the reader
// knowing which resource it names; which are valid where is checked when a
// grant is written.
//
// These continue where the data-plane bits stop rather than overlapping them,
// which is what lets one integer hold either vocabulary unambiguously: no set
// of bucket permissions can ever add up to an administrative one. Where a bit
// sits carries no meaning beyond being distinct - the stored form is the names,
// so a bit may be renumbered without touching a single row.
//
// Each is split from its neighbour where a real principal wants one and not the
// other: a monitoring credential reads status but not logs, an on-call engineer
// runs the repair passes but does not rewrite every object, and provisioning is
// alone because it can mint any other permission.
