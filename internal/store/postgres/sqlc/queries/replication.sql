-- sqlc-input definitions backing the replicator and over-replication
-- cleaner: under-replicated and over-replicated scans, the conditional
-- replica insert that returns the source row's size_bytes, and the
-- excess-copy removal. The "excluding" variant of the under-replicated
-- scan lets workers skip backends that are draining or circuit-broken.

-- name: InsertReplicaConditional :one
-- Returns the size_bytes that was actually inserted into object_locations
-- (read from the source row in the same statement). Caller uses this size
-- for IncrementBackendQuota so object_locations.size_bytes and
-- backend_quotas.bytes_used always agree, even if the in-memory copy size
-- the caller observed before InsertReplicaConditional differs from the
-- source row's current size_bytes (e.g. a concurrent overwrite landed
-- between GetUnderReplicatedObjects and the conditional insert).
-- ON CONFLICT or missing source returns no rows; the caller treats that
-- as inserted=false.
