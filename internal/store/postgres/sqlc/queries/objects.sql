-- Object Location Queries

-- sqlc-input definitions for object_locations - the canonical (object_key,
-- backend_name) ledger of which backends hold which objects. Includes the
-- transactional advisory lock primitive (LockObjectKeyForWrite) used by the
-- write path, the FOR UPDATE locks used by the per-key transactional helpers
-- in core/, and the listing queries the manager and dashboard consume.

-- a locale-collated object_key column orders the cursor differently, the merge
-- mis-pairs keys, and reconcile oscillates (false imports/removes that never
-- converge). The cursor predicate and ORDER BY must use the same collation.
