-- Pending Object Queries

-- sqlc-input definitions for pending_objects - the in-flight PUT intent
-- table that backs the PUT-before-COMMIT write-path pattern. Covers
-- inserting an intent, atomically claiming and resolving it, and the
-- timestamp-aware reaper scan that finds stale rows surviving a failed
-- metadata commit.

INSERT INTO pending_objects (
    intent_id, object_key, backend_name, size_bytes,

-- name: GetStalePendingObjects :many
-- Return pending intents older than @older_than for reaper resolution.
-- Bounded by @max_keys per call so a backlog cannot starve other queries.

-- name: CountPendingObjects :one
SELECT COUNT(*)::bigint FROM pending_objects;

-- name: DeletePendingObjectsByBackend :exec
-- Used during backend remove/drain finalization so abandoned intents do not
-- outlive their backend's row in backend_quotas (FK cascade safety).
DELETE FROM pending_objects WHERE backend_name = $1;

-- name: LockPendingForUpdate :one
-- Returns the pending row under FOR UPDATE so two concurrent reapers cannot
-- both attempt to promote the same intent. pgx.ErrNoRows means another
-- instance already resolved this intent (deleted the row); the caller
-- treats that as a benign no-op.
