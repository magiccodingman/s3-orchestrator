// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Admin API Client - Shared Transport
//
// Author: Alex Freidah
//
// The HTTP half of talking to the admin API, shared by every out-of-process
// consumer: request construction, token auth, the deadline split between
// one-shot calls and progress streams, and the typed non-2xx error.
//
// The wire shapes already live in one place (transport/admin/adminapi) so the
// server and its clients cannot disagree about JSON. This package is the same
// argument applied to the transport: adminctl and the TUI previously carried
// their own copies of all of it, including two independently written parsers
// for the same error body.
//
// Presentation stays with the caller. This package returns values and errors;
// it never renders, never writes to a terminal, and never chooses an exit code.
