// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Progress - Per-Item Observer for Long-Running Operations
//
// Author: Alex Freidah
//
// A shared, transport-agnostic observer that long-running operations (backfill,
// reconcile, scrub, replicate, purge) emit through to report per-item progress.
// Each unit of work brackets a start and an end event carrying the item label,
// outcome, and duration. A leaf package with no app dependencies so the worker
// and proxy layers can emit and the transport layer can render without a cycle.
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

package progress

// Phase marks the start or end of one unit of work.
type Phase int

const (
	PhaseStart Phase = iota // the unit began
	PhaseEnd                // the unit finished
)

// Outcome values reported on a PhaseEnd step.
//
// StatusFailed means the work ran and the item did not pass. StatusUnreadable
// means it never ran, because the item could not be retrieved: a distinct word
// so an item the worker could not even look at is not reported as one it
// judged and rejected. StatusSkipped means the pass looked at the item and
// decided against acting on it, which is a success for passes that are
// supposed to be selective - a compression run over media declines almost
// everything, and reporting that as failure would make a healthy run look
// broken.

	StatusOK         = "ok"
	StatusFailed     = "failed"

// Step is one progress notification for a single unit of work. Status and
// Duration are set on PhaseEnd only.

// Observer receives a start and then an end step for each unit of work. A nil
// Observer means progress reporting is disabled.

// Track brackets one unit of work: it emits a start step, runs fn, then emits an
// end step with the status fn returns and the elapsed time. fn always runs, so a
// nil observer disables reporting without changing behavior.
