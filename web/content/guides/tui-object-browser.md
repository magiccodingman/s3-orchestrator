This guide walks through `s3-orchestrator tui`, the built-in terminal UI. It is a read-only way to explore the object namespace, see exactly which backends hold a copy of an object, and check backend status - without leaving the shell or opening the web dashboard.

## Overview

A persistent left navigation bar switches between sections; the content area to its right renders the active one:

- **Files** - a hierarchical listing of the object namespace, one prefix at a time (directories collapse into common prefixes, just like `aws s3 ls`). Large prefixes page in as you scroll. Opening an object swaps the content area for the **Inspector**, which lists every backend copy of that object with its size, age, encryption status, key id, and content-hash prefix - the replica-placement view that makes multi-backend storage legible.
- **Backends** - one row per configured backend with its circuit-breaker health, drain state, quota usage, object count, and per-period request and transfer counters.
- **Replication** - the configured replication factor and the current under- and over-replicated object counts, refreshing on its own while the section is active.
- **Workers** - each background service's last-tick health: last success, last failure, consecutive failure count, and last error. A service that runs but fails every tick is invisible in `/health`; this is where it shows up.
- **Cleanup** - the cleanup queue and its dead-letter table, with the depth of each. The one write action here is requeueing a backend's dead-lettered rows.
- **Cache** - the object data cache's entry count, bytes held against its maximum, and lifetime hit rate.
- **Logs** - recent structured log entries from the instance's in-memory log buffer (the same source the web dashboard's logs pane reads): time, level, component, and a human-readable message with its attributes appended as `key=value` pairs.
- **Ops** - the menu of instance-wide admin actions (rebalance, scrub, backfill, reconcile, cache flush), each behind a `y/N` confirmation.

The pane that currently has keyboard focus renders with a bright title bar while the other is muted, so it is always clear whether keys drive the sidebar or the content.

Browsing is read-only: the listing, inspector, and every status pane issue `GET` requests to the admin API and never mutate state. The Ops menu and the Cleanup pane's requeue are the exceptions, and both ask before they act.

## Prerequisites

- A running orchestrator instance.
- A keypair holding the control-plane permissions you want to use - the `auth.root` one, or a narrower credential the store has issued. See the [configuration walkthrough](../../docs/configuration/).

## Step 1: Point the TUI at your instance

The TUI signs every request, so it needs a keypair; it comes from the flags or the environment and never from the server's config file. The address resolves **flag &rarr; environment &rarr; config file**. For a local instance the bundled `config.yaml` carries the address, so only the credential has to be supplied:

```bash
export S3O_ACCESS_KEY_ID="$(your-secret-tool get access-key)"
export S3O_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="$(your-secret-tool get secret-key)"
s3-orchestrator tui
```

To target a remote instance without a local config, name the address too:

```bash
export S3O_ADMIN_ADDR="https://s3.example.com"
s3-orchestrator tui
```

Or pass all three as flags:

```bash
s3-orchestrator tui -addr https://s3.example.com \
  -access-key "$ACCESS_KEY" -secret-key "$SECRET_KEY"
```

## Step 2: Navigate the object namespace

The TUI opens on the Files section at the root prefix. Move the selection with the arrow keys; open the highlighted row with `enter`. `tab` moves focus to the sidebar (arrow keys then move the highlight, `enter` opens a section), and a letter jumps straight to a section.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `tab` | Move focus between the sidebar and the content area |
| `f` | Jump to the Files section |
| `b` | Jump to the Backends section |
| `p` | Jump to the Replication section |
| `w` | Jump to the Workers section |
| `u` | Jump to the Cleanup section |
| `c` | Jump to the Cache section |
| `l` | Jump to the Logs section |
| `o` | Jump to the Ops section |
| `up` / `down` | Move the selection (or the sidebar highlight when it has focus) |
| `enter` / `right` / `l` | Open: a sidebar section, a prefix, or the inspector on an object |
| `backspace` / `left` / `h` | Go up one prefix; from the inspector or Backends, return to where you were |
| `/` | Filter the current listing by substring |
| `s` | Cycle the sort order (name / size) |
| `esc` | Clear the filter; from the inspector or Backends, step back |
| `r` | Reload the current view |
| `q` / `ctrl+c` | Quit |

Long prefixes load lazily - scrolling past the bottom of a truncated page pulls the next batch, so you can walk a bucket with millions of keys without loading it all at once.

To find something in a crowded prefix, press `/` and type - the listing narrows to matching names as you type (the status line shows how many of the loaded rows match), and `esc` clears the filter. Press `s` to cycle the sort order between name and size; directories always sort ahead of objects. Sizes render in binary units (`KiB`, `MiB`, `GiB`).

## Step 3: Inspect an object's copies

Highlight an object (not a directory) and press `enter` to open the inspector. Each row is one backend copy:

```
inspect   photos/2024/img_01.jpg   (2 copies)
tags: (none)
BACKEND    SIZE      LOGICAL   COMP   CREATED   ENC   KEY ID       HASH          VERIFIED
minio-a    1.9 MiB   2.4 MiB   zstd   2h ago    yes   vault:tra~   9f3a2b1c4d~   1h ago
minio-c    1.9 MiB   2.4 MiB   zstd   2h ago    yes   vault:tra~   9f3a2b1c4d~   1h ago
```

![The inspector showing an object's two backend copies](/docs/images/tui-file-details.png?classes=lightbox)

Reading the columns:

- **BACKEND** - the backend the copy lives on.
- **SIZE** - stored size in binary units (ciphertext size when the copy is encrypted).
- **LOGICAL** - the object's size before compression, or `-` when the copy is stored as written.
- **COMP** - the codec the copy is compressed with, or `-` when it is not compressed.
- **CREATED** - how long ago the copy was recorded.
- **ENC** - whether the copy is envelope-encrypted.
- **KEY ID** - the master key that wrapped this copy's data-encryption key.
- **HASH** - a prefix of the plaintext SHA-256, once a hash has been computed.
- **VERIFIED** - how long ago the copy's bytes were last read back and checked against that hash, or `never` while nothing has checked it.

Two copies with matching sizes and hashes is a healthy replicated object. A single row means the object is under-replicated (or replication is disabled); a mismatch in size or hash across copies is worth investigating.

The inspector shows encryption *metadata* only. The wrapped data-encryption key is never sent over the admin API - only the `encrypted` flag and the wrapping `key_id` are exposed.

## Step 4: Check backend status

Press `b` (or select **Backends** in the sidebar) to switch to the status view. Each row is one configured backend:

```
backends   3 configured   usage period: 2026-09
db: healthy   total: 11.3 GiB / 20.0 GiB (56%)   verified: oldest 9h   compression saved: 3.4 GiB
BACKEND    HEALTH     DRAIN     USED      LIMIT      USE%   OBJECTS   API    INGRESS   EGRESS    SAVED
minio-a    healthy    -         2.4 GiB   10.0 GiB   24%    1284      9021   4.7 GiB   2.8 GiB   612.0 MiB
minio-b    healthy    draining  8.9 GiB   10.0 GiB   89%    4102      512    1.0 GiB   3.1 GiB   2.8 GiB
minio-c    unhealthy  -         0 B       -          -      0         0      0 B       0 B       0 B
```

The second line carries fleet-wide state. `verified:` is how far behind
integrity checking is: an age when every copy has been checked at least once,
or a count of never-checked copies while the first sweep is still running.

![The Backends section listing per-backend health and usage](/docs/images/tui-backends.png?classes=lightbox)

Reading the columns:

- **HEALTH** - the backend's circuit-breaker state; `unhealthy` means the breaker has tripped and the backend is being skipped.
- **DRAIN** - `draining` while a drain is evacuating the backend, otherwise `-`.
- **USED** / **LIMIT** / **USE%** - quota bytes used against the configured limit (`-` when no limit is set), and the fill percentage that follows from them.
- **OBJECTS** - object copies the backend holds.
- **API** / **INGRESS** / **EGRESS** - request count and bytes transferred for the current usage period, shown in the title bar.
- **SAVED** - bytes compression kept off this backend, summed across its copies.

The title bar also reports the metadata database health and the usage period the counters cover. Press `r` to refresh the snapshot. This is the interactive equivalent of `s3-orchestrator admin status`.

## Step 5: Watch recent activity

Press `l` (or select **Logs** in the sidebar) to switch to the logs view - recent structured log entries from the instance's in-memory buffer, the same source the web dashboard reads. Each row is the time, level, component, and a human-readable message with its structured attributes appended as `key=value` pairs, so you can follow what the instance is doing (PUTs, replication copies, drains, cleanup ticks) without tailing container logs. The level is colour-coded by severity so warnings and errors stand out. Press `L` to cycle the minimum-level filter (all / INFO / WARN / ERROR) and `r` to refresh.

## Step 6: Check the background services

Press `w` (or select **Workers**) for each registered background service's last-tick health: last success, last failure, consecutive failure count, and last error. A service that runs every tick and fails every tick is indistinguishable from a healthy one in `/health`, so this is where that difference surfaces; the title bar counts the services currently failing.

![The Workers section listing each background service's last-tick health](/docs/images/tui-workers.png?classes=lightbox)

The neighbouring status sections read the same way: `p` for the replication factor and the under- and over-replicated counts, `u` for the cleanup queue and its dead-letter table, and `c` for the object cache's entry count, size, and hit rate.

## Step 7: Run an admin action

Press `o` (or select **Ops**) for the instance-wide actions, grouped into the maintenance passes, cache control, and the encryption transitions. Every entry confirms with `y/N` before it runs, and an entry ending in `...` prompts for a value first.

![The Ops menu listing the instance-wide admin actions](/docs/images/tui-ops.png?classes=lightbox)

Accepting an action switches to a scrolling output pane immediately, so a pass that takes minutes reports what it is doing rather than leaving the menu live until it finishes. Actions that target a single row live on the pane that shows the row instead: drain and reconcile on Backends, requeue on Cleanup.

## Where it fits

The TUI is the interactive equivalent of `s3-orchestrator admin object-locations -key <key>`. Reach for it when you want to browse rather than look up a single key - for example to confirm replica placement before or after a [drain](../../docs/operations/), or to spot-check that a newly enabled [replication factor](../replication-guide/) has caught up across backends.
