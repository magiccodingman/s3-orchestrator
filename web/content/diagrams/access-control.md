Access control: the one credential type, the user it proves, and the grants that decide what that user reaches on every surface. **Hover over any component** for implementation details.

### How it works

There is one credential: an access key and a secret. It arrives as an AWS SigV4 signature, as presigned query parameters, or typed into the dashboard's login form, and all three resolve the same way. Nothing authorizes by being a particular kind of secret; a credential proves an identity, and that identity's grants answer everything after.

A **grant** pairs a user with a resource and a set of permissions. There are three kinds of resource, and they name three genuinely different things rather than three layers of one:

- **`bucket:photos`** - the virtual bucket clients address. Object access lives here.
- **`backend:wasabi-eu`** - one storage provider the orchestrator writes to. A single object in a bucket may have copies on several backends at once, and a backend grant is about those copies rather than about the objects a client sees. `backend:*` is every provider, including ones added later.
- **`orchestrator`** - the service running in front of both, and what a grant names for work belonging to no single bucket or provider: reading logs, rotating keys, flushing the cache, creating users. It carries no name, because a deployment has one orchestrator.

The permissions are a bitmask - `list`, `read`, `write`, `delete`, `tags`, `list-buckets` on the data plane, and ten `admin-*` permissions on the control plane, in a disjoint bit range. A data-plane set can therefore never be mistaken for an administrative one.

#### Why one registry

The registry is assembled from both places a deployment declares credentials - the config file and the store - and published behind an atomic pointer. A credential issued or revoked through the provisioning API takes effect on the next request rather than the next restart, and the S3 path, the admin API and the dashboard all read the same pointer, so none of them can disagree about who a key belongs to.

That is also what makes the root credential unremarkable. `auth.root` merges in as a user holding every permission on every resource; it reaches everything because of what it holds, not because the request path checks for it.

#### Why verification is constant time

An access key the registry does not hold still computes a full HMAC, against a fixed dummy secret, before the comparison fails. Returning early on an unknown key would make an unknown key measurably faster than a known one with a wrong secret, which is enough to enumerate valid access keys without ever guessing a secret.

## How a permission set is stored

A grant records a resource and a permission set. The resource is one of three kinds - `bucket:name`, `backend:name` (or `backend:*`), or `orchestrator` - and the kind decides which vocabulary the set is drawn from: a bucket takes the six data-plane permissions, a backend or the orchestrator takes the ten `admin-*` ones.

The set itself is a single `uint64`. Each permission is one bit, so a grant is one integer column rather than a join table, and authorizing a request is one bitwise `AND` rather than a query.

The two vocabularies occupy **disjoint bits**. The control-plane permissions continue where the data-plane ones stop:

```text
 bit  15 14 13 12 11 10  9  8  7  6    5  4  3  2  1  0
      +-----------------------------+ +-----------------+
      |  ten admin-* permissions    | |  six bucket     |
      |  64 .. 32768                | |  1 .. 32        |
      +-----------------------------+ +-----------------+
```

Which bit a permission sits on carries no meaning beyond being distinct from every other. The stored form is the names - `permissions` is a `TEXT` column holding `list,read`, not an integer - so the bitmask is rebuilt in memory on every registry assembly and a bit could be renumbered without touching a single row.

### The data-plane bits

Carried by a grant on a **bucket**.

<table class="bittab">
  <tr><th>Bit</th><th>Mask</th><th>Value</th><th>Name</th><th>Allows</th></tr>
  <tr><td class="c-bit">0</td><td class="c-mask">0x0001</td><td class="c-dec">1</td><td class="c-name n-data">list-buckets</td><td class="c-what">Knowing the bucket exists - it appears in a bucket listing</td></tr>

</table>

`list-buckets` and `list` are separate because they answer different questions: a client may be entitled to know a bucket exists without being entitled to enumerate what is in it. It is the same split AWS draws between `s3:ListAllMyBuckets` and `s3:ListBucket`.

### The control-plane bits

Carried by a grant on a **backend** or on the **orchestrator**.

</table>

Each is split from its neighbour where a real principal wants one and not the other: a monitoring credential reads status but not logs, an on-call engineer runs the repair passes but does not rewrite every object. `admin-provision` is alone because a grant carrying it can mint any other permission.

### Setting bits

A grant is built by OR-ing together the bits it was written with. `grant add -permissions list,read` combines two masks into the one integer the `permissions` column holds:

```text
     list        000010       2
  OR read        000100       4
     ------------------------------
   = stored      000110       6
```

Rendering it back is the reverse walk over the same table, which is why a set always prints in one fixed order and two equal grants read identically.

### Checking bits

A route declares what it needs. Authorizing is one `AND`, and the result has to equal what was wanted rather than merely be non-zero:

```go
func (p PermissionSet) Has(want PermissionSet) bool {
	return p&want == want
}
```

A `GET` on an object needs `read`, and the grant above carries it:

```text
     held        000110       6     list,read
 AND want        000100       4     read
     ------------------------------
   = result      000100       4     == want   -> allowed
```

A `DELETE` on the same bucket needs `delete`, which that grant does not carry:

```text
     held        000110       6     list,read
 AND want        010000      16     delete
     ------------------------------
   = result      000000       0     != want   -> 403
```

The `== want` rather than `!= 0` matters whenever a route declares more than one bit: a grant holding one of two required permissions is refused, which is the difference between "may do any of these" and "may do this operation".

### Why the two vocabularies cannot be confused

Take the most permissive bucket grant there is - `all`, every data-plane bit lit - and check it against a control-plane permission:

```text
                  admin        bucket
     held       0000000000     111111        63    bucket grant: all
 AND want       0000010000     000000      4096    admin-drain
     ----------------------------------------
   = result     0000000000     000000         0    != want  -> 403
```

The two operands share no bit, so the result is zero no matter how much access the bucket grant carries. There is no combination of data-plane permissions that adds up to an administrative one, and none that can be reached by arithmetic on a stored value.

In practice that check never even runs. `ValidatePermissions` refuses a set carrying permissions the resource has no meaning for when the grant is **written** rather than when it is checked, so `grant add -name photos -permissions admin-drain` is rejected outright rather than stored as a grant that would authorize nothing. The disjoint bits are the second line of defence behind that, and the reason a hand-edited row still cannot cross the line.

### What an empty set means

An empty set is read differently on each side, and deliberately so.

An empty **bucket** grant carries all six data-plane bits (`63`). Rows predate the permission vocabulary and authorized everything within the bucket they named, so reading them as nothing on upgrade would have refused clients that were working the day before.

An empty **backend or orchestrator** grant carries nothing (`0`). No control-plane row predates this vocabulary, so there is no prior meaning to preserve, and defaulting one to everything is the wrong direction to be generous in.

### Combining grants

Merging two sets is an `OR`, which is how a user's grants from config and from the store come together. A wildcard grant is the exception: a **named** grant replaces the wildcard for the bucket it names rather than being OR-ed into it.

That has to be a replacement, because OR-ing would make a carve-out impossible to express. A user granted broad `read` across every bucket could never be narrowed to `list-buckets` on the one holding secrets - the broader bit would always survive the union.
