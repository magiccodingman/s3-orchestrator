At-rest compression: how an object is encoded on write and reassembled on read, and why the stored format is chunked. **Hover over any component** for implementation details.

### How it works

Objects are stored as **chunked zstd** in the Zstandard seekable format: one independently decodable frame per `chunk_size` of input, with a seek table in a trailing skippable frame. Sizes, ETags and content hashes stay those of the object the client wrote.

Storage and transfer are both metered on the backends this project targets, so compression reduces the bill twice. That second saving only holds if a partial read stays cheap, which is what drives the format.

#### Why the format is chunked

Compression emits backreferences into earlier data, so decoding can only begin at a frame boundary. One frame per object gives exactly one entry point, byte zero, so any range read would have to fetch the whole stored object and discard everything before the offset. The cost of a partial read becomes proportional to object size rather than to the bytes asked for, which is the wrong trade for a proxy whose backends meter egress.

Splitting into independently decodable frames gives one entry point per chunk, at the cost of an index and a small ratio penalty. At the 1 MiB default that penalty is about 2.5% on Go source and negative on JSON logs.

#### Writing an object

1. **Check the size floor**: objects below `min_size` are stored verbatim, because a seek table and per-frame headers cost more than a small object saves.
2. **Encode**: the buffered body is encoded into a second buffer, one frame per `chunk_size`, with the seek table appended.
3. **Check the ratio floor**: an encoding above `min_ratio` of the original size is discarded and the object stored verbatim. The decision is made by encoding and measuring, not by sampling, because entropy is not uniform across an object.
4. **Admit against the encoded size**: unlike encryption, whose overhead is a fixed function of the size, an encoder only reports its output once it has run. A compressed write is therefore admitted after encoding rather than before.
5. **Encrypt, if enabled**: compression runs first, in that order only, because ciphertext does not compress.
6. **Upload and record the stored form**: `compression_algorithm`, `compression_level`, `compression_format_version` and `logical_size`. A NULL algorithm is the ledger's way of saying the bytes are verbatim, so no separate boolean can drift out of step with it.

#### Reading an object

A compressed copy is never served by a whole-object GET. The codec drives the read instead:

1. **Read the seek table** from the trailing skippable frame, which maps a logical offset to the frame holding it.
2. **Map the client's range** onto the frames covering it.
3. **Fetch those frames** with one ranged backend GET each, decrypting them first when the copy is an envelope.
4. **Decode and slice** to the exact bytes the client asked for.

Each frame fetch is charged its own API call and egress, on the bytes that actually left the backend. Charging once per client request would under-report all but the first.

#### The two thresholds

`min_size` and `min_ratio` exist because an object can fail to benefit for two different reasons. `min_size` is about framing overhead on small objects; `min_ratio` is about entropy - already-compressed content, media and archives gain nothing at any size. Objects declined by either are stored exactly as the client sent them, and nothing on the read path distinguishes the two cases, because nothing needs to.
