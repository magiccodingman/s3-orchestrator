Object tagging: the four ways a tag set is written, the one place it is stored, the two ways it is read back, and what clears it. **Hover over any component** for implementation details.

### How it works

A tag set is key/value labels attached to an object independently of its data. Tags are yours to give meaning to: the one place the orchestrator acts on a tag itself is [lifecycle expiration](../../docs/cleanup-and-lifecycle/#lifecycle-object-expiration), where a rule can filter on one. Otherwise they are stored, shared by every replica, and served back as written, and no key is treated specially.

The set is stored once per object key, never per copy. An object exists as N replicas with no authoritative copy, so per-replica rows would let three copies of a key disagree with nothing to say which one wins. That also keeps tagging off the providers entirely, which matters because provider support is inconsistent and a backend sitting over its usage limit could not be tagged at all.

#### Four ways in, two ways out

`PutObject` and `CreateMultipartUpload` take the set inline as `x-amz-tagging`, query-string encoded. `PutObjectTagging` takes it as a `Tagging` XML document on the `?tagging` subresource. `CopyObject` either carries the source's set or replaces it, depending on `x-amz-tagging-directive`. All four converge on the same validation and the same rows.

Reads split by what the caller needs. `GetObjectTagging` returns the tags themselves and is the only way to see them. `GetObject` and `HeadObject` report just how many, in `x-amz-tagging-count`, so a client can decide whether that second round trip is worth making.

#### Why validation happens early

An inline header is parsed and checked before the request body is read. Refusing later means the bytes have already been transferred and written, leaving an orphan to collect and the ingress already spent. For a multipart upload the same logic applies across a longer window: the set is validated at create, so an upload that would end in a rejected tag set is refused before any part is transferred rather than after all of them.
