How a backend call is admitted against its monthly budgets, what it charges, and where those counters live. **Hover over any component** for implementation details.

### How it works

Every call the orchestrator makes to a backend is admitted against that backend's monthly budgets before it goes out, and recorded after. Three dimensions are enforced: **egress bytes**, **ingress bytes**, and **requests**. The first two are scalars. Requests are not, because providers do not bill them as one.

#### Why requests are pooled

Providers group operations into billing classes with separate allowances, and they disagree about the grouping. GCS meters uploads, copies and listings from a small Class A allowance, reads from a Class B allowance ten times its size, and does not bill deletes at all. B2 inverts it: uploads and deletes are free, downloads and listings are charged from two different classes. OCI meters every request from one pooled allowance. IDrive e2 does not meter requests at all.

Charging every operation against a single `api_request_limit` forces a bad choice: set it to the strictest class and the rest of the headroom is wasted, set it to the loosest and the strict one is blown. In production that second failure took a GCS backend out of service on a 5,000 upload allowance while its 50,000 read allowance sat 98.7% unused - and because the read path checks the same counter, the backend stopped serving reads too.

A backend therefore declares **pools**: named budgets, each covering a set of operations.

```yaml
unmetered: [DeleteObject, DeleteObjects, AbortMultipartUpload]
request_limits:
  - name: class_a
    operations: [PutObject, CopyObject, ListObjects, ListObjectsV2]
    limit: 5000
  - name: class_b
    operations: [GetObject, HeadObject, GetParts]
    limit: 50000
```

#### The rules

1. **Pools are additive.** An operation charges every pool containing it and is admitted only when all of them have headroom. That is what lets a per-operation sub-cap sit inside an aggregate one.
2. **`"*"` covers everything not listed as `unmetered`.** A bare `api_request_limit` desugars to exactly one such pool, named `all`, so configs written before pools existed keep their old meaning.
3. **`limit: 0` counts without refusing.** Same convention the byte limits use.
4. **Unmetered means uncharged, not unrecorded.** A free operation still increments the backend's request total; it simply charges no pool. Not being billed for a call is not a reason to stop reporting that it happened.
5. **Deletes are never refused**, on any budget. Refusing one would leave an operator over a limit with no way back under it, and a client `DELETE` that returns without deleting is simply wrong.

Because pools overlap, their counts do not sum to the request total and are not a decomposition of it.

#### What a refusal looks like

Admission is the same check on both paths; only the consequence differs. A **write** filters over-budget backends out of placement, so the object lands on another backend, or the client gets `507 Insufficient Storage` when none is eligible. A **read** skips over-budget copies and fails over to another; when every copy is on an over-budget backend the client gets `429 Too Many Requests` with `SlowDown`.

#### Where the counters live

A charge lands in the counter backend first - local atomics, or Redis when it is configured for multi-instance deployments - and is flushed to Postgres every 30 seconds, or every 10 when a budget is close to its ceiling. Admission reads **baseline + unflushed**: the DB figure the metrics collector last loaded, plus what this process has spent since. Enforcement is deliberately approximate, bounded by one flush interval of concurrent traffic, because exact enforcement would need a lock on every request.
