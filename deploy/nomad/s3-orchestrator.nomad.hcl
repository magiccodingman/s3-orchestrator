# S3 Orchestrator - Nomad Job Specification
#
# Author: Alex Freidah
#
# Production-ready Nomad job for the s3-orchestrator. Deploys the service with
# three storage backends (OCI Object Storage, Backblaze B2, and MinIO) spanning
# multiple providers. With replication factor 2 and spread routing, every object
# is written to the least-utilized backend and asynchronously replicated to a
# second backend -- distributing copies across the pool like a storage mesh.
# Secrets are injected from HashiCorp Vault via Nomad template stanzas.
#
# Customize the variables block and Vault path, then deploy:
#   nomad job run -var="version=v1.0.0" s3-orchestrator.nomad.hcl
