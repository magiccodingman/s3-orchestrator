# S3 Orchestrator - Local Dev Nomad Job (nomad agent -dev + docker-compose)
#
# Author: Alex Freidah
#
# Simplified job for local testing against docker-compose backing services.
# No Vault dependency -- config is rendered directly with hardcoded dev
# credentials. The __HOST_IP__ placeholder is replaced by demo.sh with the
# Docker bridge gateway so the container can reach host-network services.
