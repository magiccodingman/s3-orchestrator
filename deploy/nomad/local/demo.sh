# S3 Orchestrator - Local Nomad Demo
#
# Author: Alex Freidah
#
# Stands up a complete s3-orchestrator environment using Nomad in dev mode with
# PostgreSQL and MinIO backends running via docker-compose on the host. Builds
# the image from source and submits the job. Tears down cleanly with "down".
#
# Usage:
#   ./demo.sh        # stand up the full environment
#   ./demo.sh down   # tear everything down

# Pin every Nomad AND Consul endpoint/credential to the local dev agent so a
# sourced prod profile (e.g. munchbox-env.sh) can never redirect us at a real
# cluster. The Nomad dev agent's Consul integration falls back to CONSUL_HTTP_*
# env vars, so leaving those set makes the dev agent self-register nomad/
# nomad-client services into the real Consul -- clear them too. The demo uses
# Nomad-native service discovery (provider="nomad"), so no Consul is needed.
