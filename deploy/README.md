# Deployment Examples

Production-ready deployment manifests for container orchestration platforms. Both examples deploy the s3-orchestrator with three storage backends (OCI Object Storage, Backblaze B2, MinIO), replication factor 2, spread routing, and full observability -- demonstrating how the orchestrator distributes object copies across backends like a storage mesh.

## Nomad

Single-file job specification with Vault integration for secret injection.

```bash
# Deploy with a specific version
nomad job run -var="version=v1.0.0" deploy/nomad/s3-orchestrator.nomad.hcl

# Validate without deploying
nomad job plan -var="version=v1.0.0" deploy/nomad/s3-orchestrator.nomad.hcl
```

**Prerequisites:** Vault KV v2 secret at `secret/data/s3-orchestrator` with all credential fields populated. See the inline comments in the job file for the full list of required keys.

## Kubernetes (Helm)

A Helm chart in `deploy/helm/s3-orchestrator/` deploys the full stack: Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, Secret, ServiceAccount, NetworkPolicy, and optional Ingress.

```bash
# Install with default values
helm install s3-orchestrator deploy/helm/s3-orchestrator \
  -n s3-orchestrator --create-namespace

# Install with custom values
helm install s3-orchestrator deploy/helm/s3-orchestrator \
  -n s3-orchestrator --create-namespace \
  -f my-values.yaml

# Upgrade after changing values
helm upgrade s3-orchestrator deploy/helm/s3-orchestrator \
  -n s3-orchestrator -f my-values.yaml

# Generate raw manifests without Helm (for kubectl apply workflows)
helm template s3-orchestrator deploy/helm/s3-orchestrator -f my-values.yaml > manifests.yaml
```

**Prerequisites:** A PostgreSQL instance accessible from the cluster. Configure backends, credentials, and database connection in your values file. See `deploy/helm/s3-orchestrator/values.yaml` for all available options.

## Local Demo Scripts

Both platforms include a `local/demo.sh` script that stands up a fully working environment on your machine with zero configuration. Each script starts PostgreSQL and MinIO via docker-compose, builds the image from source, and deploys the orchestrator with three backends and replication factor 2.

### Kubernetes (k3d)

```bash
./deploy/kubernetes/local/demo.sh        # stand up everything
./deploy/kubernetes/local/demo.sh down   # tear it all down
```

Requires: `docker`, `k3d`, `kubectl`, `helm`

### Nomad (dev mode)

```bash
./deploy/nomad/local/demo.sh        # stand up everything
./deploy/nomad/local/demo.sh down   # tear it all down
```

Requires: `docker`, `nomad`

Both scripts print connection details on success -- S3 API endpoint, dashboard URL, and a test upload command.

### Monitoring

The demo scripts automatically start Prometheus (port 19090) and Grafana (port 13000) alongside the backing services. Grafana is pre-configured with an anonymous admin session, the Prometheus datasource, and the s3-orchestrator dashboard from `grafana/s3-orchestrator.json`. No login required -- just open `http://localhost:13000` after the demo is running.

## Cloudflare Edge Proxy

`deploy/cloudflare-worker/` holds a Cloudflare Worker that fronts a Bandwidth Alliance backend so object egress leaves the provider to Cloudflare, which alliance members waive the transfer fee on. It verifies the caller against a proxy credential, rewrites `Host` to the native endpoint, and re-signs the request with the account credential -- without which a proxied CNAME breaks both bucket routing and the SigV4 signature.

```bash
make worker-check   # typecheck and test
make worker-deploy  # wrangler deploy
```

See `deploy/cloudflare-worker/README.md` for the credential model and the matching backend entry.

## Customization

Both examples include commented-out sections for:

- **TLS termination** at the application level (cert + key file paths)
- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)** client certificate verification via `client_ca_file`
- **Traefik/nginx Ingress** routing annotations
- **Vault Agent Injector** integration (Kubernetes)
- **Distributed tracing** via OTLP gRPC (Tempo, Jaeger)

All sensitive values use `${VAR}` environment variable expansion -- the orchestrator resolves these at startup, so secrets never appear in config files on disk.

## PostgreSQL

These examples assume an existing PostgreSQL instance. The orchestrator creates its schema automatically on startup -- no manual migration required. Point `database.host` at your PostgreSQL endpoint and ensure the configured user has `CREATE TABLE` privileges on the target database.
